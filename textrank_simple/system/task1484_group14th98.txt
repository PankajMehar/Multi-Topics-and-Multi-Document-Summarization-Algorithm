The protest is seen as a test of how the independence movement’s support has fared since the Catalan government declared independence on 27 October, prompting Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy to fire its members, dissolve the regional parliament and call new elections for December.
In 2010, the PP successfully lobbied the constitutional court to annul or reinterpret parts of the statute, thereby ensuring that Catalonia was not recognised as a nation within Spain and the Catalan language was not given precedence over Castilian.Joshua Wong, the most prominent of Hong Kong's student protest leaders, alleged he was assaulted by police who used excessive force -- including repeatedly grabbing his genitals -- during his arrest at pro-democracy demonstrations.
“We feel that the government feels no pressure if this movement simply drags on like this,” said Oscar Lai, a leader of Scholarism, a protest group of high school and university students, who urged protesters to peacefully block the Hong Kong leader’s office.
Immediately after a declaration of independence by separatist lawmakers in the Catalan parliament, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain invoked emergency powers, removed Mr. Puigdemont and his government, and called for elections on Dec. 21 for a new regional parliament in Catalonia, in the hope that voters would replace the separatists.
