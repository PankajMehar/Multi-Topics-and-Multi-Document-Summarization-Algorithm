Labour shadow minister says football governing body should 'revisit decision' to let Russia host cup after Crimea annexation
Football authorities should look at stopping Russia from hosting the Fifa World Cup in 2018 over its annexation of Crimea, a Labour frontbencher has said.
The shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, made the suggestion as the EU imposed further sanctions on 12 Russians connected to the Kremlin as punishment for taking over part of Ukraine.
Speaking on BBC Question Time, he said it was Fifa's decision to make but it should "revisit" that choice.
Clive Efford, Labour's shadow sports minister, later said that no country should "unilaterally boycott" the 2018 World Cup in Russia but "Fifa should discuss contingency plans today in case the situation escalates".
The EU is now looking at other possible financial sanctions in case the crisis escalates – for example if Russia moves into eastern Ukraine.
An EU-Russia summit in June will be cancelled along regular bilateral meetings between member states and Moscow.
Herman van Rompuy, the European Council president, said: "We make clear that failure to settle the crisis peacefully, and any steps by Russia to destabilise Ukraine, will have far-reaching consequences – and by that we mean consequences on relations in a broad range of economic areas."
Leaving the summit, David Cameron said that the EU was sending a "clear, strong and consistent message".
"It has been hard work but we've made some real progress," he said.
Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, condemned the international sanctions as "absolutely unlawful".
