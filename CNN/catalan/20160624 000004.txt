Story highlights President Joe Biden will caution the U.S.'s British allies during remarks in Ireland on Friday
Biden said earlier he and President Barack Obama had wished for a different outcome
Palo Alto, California (CNN) Instability in Europe and beyond is providing "fertile terrain for reactionary politicians and demagogues," Vice President Joe Biden cautioned during remarks in Ireland on Friday.
Listing global irritants like mass migration, terrorism, climate change, Biden said those factors are leading to leaders "peddling xenophobia, nationalism, and isolationism," including in the United States.
