Award-winning director fears six months of work on Yuri Arabov-scripted movie may have been wasted
Russian film-makers have been forced to halt production on a new movie due to the political turmoil in Crimea.
In comments first noted by the Hollywood Reporter, award-winning director Andrei Proshkin said on his Facebook page that production on the film Orlean had been halted with immediate effect. The feature, written by Yuri Arabov, the winner of the prize for best screenplay at the 1999 Cannes film festival, had been due to shoot in the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula but is now shrouded in uncertainty.
"Six months of pre-production, selection of locations, preliminary work on location in February, when there were still no signs that the current events in Crimea could occur â€“ all that went down the drain," complained Proshkin, who won best director at the Moscow film festival for his previous film Orda (The Horde).
The director said all crew members had returned home to Russia's capital amid fears that the film's losses may not be covered under the insurance industry's force majeure standard. Scheduling issues for actors may prevent production restarting in timely fashion.
Ironically, Proshkin is a member of a group of Russian film-makers who oppose the Kremlin's actions in Crimea, and recently signed a missive offering support for their Ukrainian counterparts against the background of military encroachment.
