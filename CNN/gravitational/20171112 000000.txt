MADRID — In his first visit to Catalonia since taking control of the restive region in Spain, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Sunday urged Catalans to vote in next month’s elections to defeat the independence movement and return the region to “normality.”
Mr. Rajoy, addressing Catalan supporters of his conservative Popular Party, rejected criticism of the jailing of separatist politicians, a day after hundreds of thousands of pro-independence demonstrators marched in Barcelona, the Catalan capital, to demand their release.
“In Spain, you can defend any idea,” Mr. Rajoy said, but only as long as it is done within the rule of law.
Mr. Rajoy’s government took charge of Catalonia on Oct. 27, using emergency powers under Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, shortly after separatist lawmakers voted for independence from Spain. He fired the Catalan government, dissolved the Catalan Parliament and set new regional elections for Dec. 21.
After Mr. Rajoy imposed direct rule on Catalonia, the region’s former leader, Carles Puigdemont, arrived in Brussels. He is fighting an arrest warrant issued by Spain’s judiciary to force him and four other Catalan politicians to return to Madrid to stand trial on charges including rebellion. Other members of the former Catalan government were recently jailed without bail.

But ahead of the December elections, the independence movement has shown signs of strain. Mr. Puigdemont failed this past week to strike an agreement between the two main Catalan parties to renew the joint, pro-independence ticket that brought them into office in late 2015.
