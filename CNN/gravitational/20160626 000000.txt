Story highlights Millions sign petition calling for second Brexit referendum, in the wake of shock Leave win
Its creator has sought to distance himself from the petition because he is a Leave voter
London (CNN) An online petition signed by more than 3.5 million people calling for a second referendum on whether Britain should leave the EU was started by a Leave campaigner who says it has been "hijacked" by unhappy Remain voters.
The petition, which has attracted millions of signatures in the wake of Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union last Thursday, calls for a second referendum on the issue if the result is less than decisive.

Another referendum should be held, it says, "if the remain or leave vote is less than 60 percent based a turnout less than 75 percent." In a startling result, the Leave campaign won Thursday's referendum with 52% of the vote, with 72% of voters turning out.
Disappointed voters have flocked to sign the petition in the wake of the vote, crashing the official UK government website on at least one occasion and generating more signatures than on any other petition on the site.

But the surge in interest has prompted its creator, William Oliver Healey, to speak out, saying that he in fact he had actively supported the Leave campaign, and had created the petition "with the intention of making it harder for 'remain' to further shackle us to the EU."
