Story highlights Farage: Our political leaders "let us down like a cheap pair of braces"
Of European parliament members: "They don't like me. It's mutual," he says
(CNN) Nigel Farage, the man who helped orchestrate the United Kingdom's pending exit from the European Union, said in a nearly 10-minute interview with CNN's Richard Quest Tuesday that it's time to "stop the silliness" and get down to work.
Fresh off the boos and turned backs that greeted his appearance at the European Council earlier in the day, Farage said warnings of economic chaos following the vote won't come to pass, but suggested even if they do, it would be worth it.
"Freedom, independence, democracy, not being a slave to somebody else is something on which you can't put a price," he said. "And what we did last Thursday is we voted to take back our country, to take back our laws, our courts, our borders, our pride and our self-respect."
Farage, a member of the European parliament since 1999, derided his fellow members who booed him Tuesday when he spoke at the Council meeting in Brussels, the first since U.K. voters approved the exit referendum.
"Now look," Farage told Quest, laughing. "They were abusing me from the moment I started. Twice the President had to cease proceedings and say, 'Please listen to Mr. Farage."
