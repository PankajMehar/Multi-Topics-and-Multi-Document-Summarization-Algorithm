The director of the National Science Foundation has already implemented “national interest” guidelines for new grants. Contrary to your suggestion, the LIGO project would certainly fall under the legislation’s national interest definition to “promote the progress of science in the United States.”
This accomplishment, the product of decades of public investment, contrasts sharply with other projects funded by the foundation, like $700,000 to underwrite a climate change musical, $500,000 to create a video game for adults called “Prom Week,” or $275,000 to survey tourism in northern Norway.
In a Feb. 16 editorial, you criticized my bill, the Scientific Research in the National Interest Act, which recently passed the House requiring the National Science Foundation to explain how each project is worthy of taxpayer funding.
Recently, news broke of the discovery of gravitational waves, as first predicted by Albert Einstein. The National Science Foundation’s support for the LIGO project that led this effort (for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) is a perfect example of pursuing breakthrough science that is in the national interest.
To the Editor:
By coincidence, at about the same time that the LIGO discovery was announced, the House passed a bill requiring that National Science Foundation grants be justified “in the national interest.” It is doubtful that LIGO would have survived such political meddling. The bottom line is that whatever else it may be or lead to, the story of the chirp heard round the universe is simply cool. For proof, just listen to that little song.
