But if the referendum campaign has taught us anything, it is that predictions about what would happen after a leave vote were tricky to get right.The ONS said the unemployment rate had edged down from 5% to 4.9% and was last lower in the July to September period of 2005.Speaking after Merkel, May said that both sides wanted to maintain "the closest possible economic relations between our two countries, and I believe that is what German and British business want too."
But Merkel said that while the general issue of the impending Brexit would be broached, neither formal nor informal negotiations on the subject could begin until Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty -- which officially kicks off the exit process and opens a two-year window for exit negotiations -- was triggered.
Bilateral relationships and trade between them would continue after Britain's departure from the European Union, she said.
Speaking at a press conference alongside May ahead of the working dinner between two of the world's most powerful women, Merkel said that Britain and Germany had friendly relations and shared values.
