"Like the vast, vast majority of people, I have been shocked and disgusted at some the cases of racial or anti-immigrant abuse that have been reported this week," she wrote in a blog on the NPCC's website
"By all means write letters, go on marches, do everything you can. But this is just a quiet way to show, 'Hey it's fine, I'm with you.'"
However, critics -- like former CNN host Piers Morgan -- argue that the call to action does nothing to combat hate crimes, with others labeling the concept as "patronizing."
"It very clearly wasn't intended as a compliment. He was saying 'I see you, I've noticed you, that you are foreign, and I would like to tell you that you are foreign."

The National Police Chiefs' Council says 331 cases have been reported to the True Vision anti-hate crime website since last Thursday, compared to the regular weekly average of 63.
It is not clear how many of those 331 attacks are linked to the referendum, but there have been several high-profile cases tied to the vote for Brexit, the combination of words for Britain and exit that refers to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.
More than 17 million British voters (52%) backed Brexit in last week's referendum on breaking away from the EU.
