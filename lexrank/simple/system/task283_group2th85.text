“Oh, my God. It was a mistake to come here.”It is not clear how many of those 331 attacks are linked to the referendum, but there have been several high-profile cases tied to the vote for Brexit, the combination of words for Britain and exit that refers to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.
But Allison also has a few choice words for commentators who think the campaign is pointless.
"I think those people really lack a sense of empathy for what it must be like to walk into a room or step on a train -- full of strangers -- and you just have to hope that none of them are going to come after you," she says. "I completely agree. It is patronizing if you just wear the pin and think you've done your job."
Despite some backlash, Allison says most of the reaction has been "overwhelmingly positive." Three days since unwittingly launching the initiative against racism, she's thrilled by how many are taking to social media to share their #safetypins and reassure their fellow Britons that they are welcome and supported regardless of ethnicity or background.

The National Police Chiefs' Council says 331 cases have been reported to the True Vision anti-hate crime website since last Thursday, compared to the regular weekly average of 63.
More than 17 million British voters (52%) backed Brexit in last week's referendum on breaking away from the EU.
