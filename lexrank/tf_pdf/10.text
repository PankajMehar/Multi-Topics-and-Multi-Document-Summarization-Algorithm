The gravitational waves -- ripples in space-time -- were created by the merging of two black holes, Reitze said. One black hole had the mass of 29 suns; the other was the equivalent of 36 suns. Each was perhaps 50 kilometers (30 miles) in diameter.

And even for the scientists who do find what they’ve been seeking after decades of searching, life goes on. “In a certain way we’re still going through an existential crisis,” said Tim Andeen, one of the hundreds of scientists who helped find the Higgs boson particle exactly as they’d hoped to in 2012, at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva.
He and his colleagues at an experiment in China, the Daya Bay Collaboration, found an extraordinary excess of antineutrinos there, in line with two other experiments. They published their results on Saturday in the journal Physical Review Letters.
Astronomers have already exploited visible light, the infrared and ultraviolet, radio waves, x-rays and even gamma-rays in their attempt to understand the mechanics of stars, the evolution of the galaxies and the expansion of the universe from an initial big bang 13.8bn years ago.
Jon Butterworth is a physics professor at University College London. He is a member of the UCL High Energy Physics group and works on the Atlas experiment at Cern’s Large Hadron Collider. His book Smashing Physics: The Inside Story of the Hunt for the Higgs was published in May 2014“Einstein, when he came to write down his theory of gravity, his two heroes were Faraday and Maxwell,” said Turok. “He tried to write down laws of the gravitational field and he wasn’t in the least surprised to discover that his predictions had waves, gravitational waves.”
Dr. Thorne then recruited Dr. Drever, a gifted experimentalist from the University of Glasgow, to start a gravitational wave program at Caltech. Dr. Drever wanted to use light — laser beams bouncing between precisely positioned mirrors — to detect the squeeze and stretch of a passing wave.
“We had a thing to go and search for, and we got it,” he said. “Things would’ve gotten really weird if we hadn’t – we would’ve observed all kinds of things in the detector.”
