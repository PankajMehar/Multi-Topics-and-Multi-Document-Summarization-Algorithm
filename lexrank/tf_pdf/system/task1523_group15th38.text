She was later found dead, floating in the sea.The following is a partial transcript of communication between an unidentified crew member aboard the sinking South Korean ferry Sewol and local maritime traffic control centers on Wednesday. 
Mr. Werner cited current regulations that state, “If it becomes necessary to abandon the ship, the commanding officer should be the last person to leave.”
In 1991, a 500-foot-long Greek-owned cruise ship called the Oceanos flooded off the coast of South Africa in 30-foot swells after an engine explosion. Instead of evacuating the 571 people on board, the captain and his crew left, claiming later that they went to seek help.
"The ship is taking in water and sinking," a coastguard spokesman told AFP by phone as the rescue operation got under way. "There are around 450 people on board and we have coastguard vessels, commercial ships in the area, as well as helicopters all engaged in the rescue operation," the spokesman added.
Although 174 people were rescued shortly after the vessel sank Wednesday, no survivors have been found since. 
Jeju Vessel Traffic Services Center: Yes, OK. Please put on the life vests and get ready as people may have to abandon ship.  
Sewol: The ship rolled over a lot right now. Cannot move. Please come quickly. We're next to Byeongpung Island.
The transcript, translated by CNN, was provided by the South Korean government.  Due to static, CNN could not hear parts of the audio recording to corroborate the transcript.
The Sewol sent out a distress signal shortly before 9am local time. The 6,825-ton vessel had been en route from the western port of Incheon to Jeju, located about 100km (60 miles) off the mainland, when it reportedly hit rocks and began listing severely.
