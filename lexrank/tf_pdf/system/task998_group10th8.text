Astronomers have already exploited visible light, the infrared and ultraviolet, radio waves, x-rays and even gamma-rays in their attempt to understand the mechanics of stars, the evolution of the galaxies and the expansion of the universe from an initial big bang 13.8bn years ago.
“Einstein, when he came to write down his theory of gravity, his two heroes were Faraday and Maxwell,” said Turok. “He tried to write down laws of the gravitational field and he wasn’t in the least surprised to discover that his predictions had waves, gravitational waves.”
Jon Butterworth is a physics professor at University College London. He is a member of the UCL High Energy Physics group and works on the Atlas experiment at Cern’s Large Hadron Collider. His book Smashing Physics: The Inside Story of the Hunt for the Higgs was published in May 2014Based on Einstein’s theory of general relativity, new tool allows researchers to take into account ripples in spacetime, making the most accurate simulations yet
The gravitational waves -- ripples in space-time -- were created by the merging of two black holes, Reitze said. One black hole had the mass of 29 suns; the other was the equivalent of 36 suns. Each was perhaps 50 kilometers (30 miles) in diameter.
Scientists have created the most accurate way yet of simulating the way the universe expands.

Last year scientists at the collider found a tantalizing blip in the data, for instance, that Murphy said would be “incredibly hard to reconcile with the standard model”. But Andeen quickly cautioned that so far, at least, the signal is “statistically speaking not important”, and that it could easily go away as other bumps have before.
