A third mate was at the helm.  \n", "d5_sg43": "The captain was not in the steering room when the accident took place, according to police and his own account.\n", "d5_sg44": "He said he plotted the ship's course, and then went to his cabin briefly \"to tend to something.\" It was then, the captain said, that the accident happened. \n", "d5_sg45": "A crew member, described as the third mate and identified only as Park, appeared in handcuffs with Lee.  \n", "d5_sg46": "Park is facing charges including negligence and causing injuries leading to deaths, said Yang Joong-jin, a maritime police spokesman. \n", "d5_sg47": "The captain was one those rescued soon after the Sewol began to sink, violating an \"internationally recognized rule that a captain must stay on the vessel,\" maritime law attorney Jack Hickey said. \n", "d5_sg48": "\"Pretty much every law, rule, regulation and standard throughout the world says that yes, the captain must stay with the ship until all personnel are safely off of the ship, certainly passengers.\"\n", "d5_sg49": "'Teacher, please rest in peace': Students remember vice principal who took own life after ferry sinking\n", "d5_sg50": "Kang, who was vice principal at Ansan's Danwon High School, was rescued from the sinking Sewol ferry. \n", "d5_sg51": "Just two days after the accident, he was found dead after apparently hanging himself using a belt from a tree in the city of Jindo. In a note, he expressed regret he had survived while so many others had died. \n", "d5_sg52": "On a chilly Monday, around 4:30 a.m., Kang's coffin was led out of a funeral hall in a long, black hearse. It was too early for any sunlight. \n", "d5_sg53": "There were no pallbearers carrying the coffin -- only a quick walking procession of his family members and what appeared to be about a hundred others dressed in black following the car through the parking lot. \n", "d5_sg54": "His family members -- one son, two daughters and his wife dressed in all-black traditional Korean wear followed the hearse. When they reached the end of the parking lot of the funeral home, they got into the car. The whole walk took less than five minutes before the mourners got in and drove in a line of cars headed to the crematorium. \n", "d5_sg55": "Kang's body had been found Friday in one of the small mountains near the Jindo Gymnasium where bereaved families are taking shelter, according to local police. He had gone to Jindo with the school in an effort to support families, said one fellow educator.  \n", "d5_sg56": "\"As the one in charge of the safety of the students, he was suffering from guilty feelings,\" another teacher had told Korean media. When some familes directed their anger at him, he became \"brokenhearted.\" \n", "d5_sg57": "Over 300 students from the school and their teachers were aboard the ferry. Some are confirmed dead and and hope is dwindling that any more survivors will be found. 174 were rescued. Hundreds remain missing.\n", "d5_sg58": "He wrote that it was his idea for the field trip and that the deaths of the students were his fault.

The family members receive guests for about three days.\n", "d5_sg60": "During this period, several students from the high school came to the funeral home to pay their respects to Kang's family. Dressed in their school uniforms, they bowed to the family.\n", "d5_sg61": "\"He was an ethics teacher,\" said freshman Choi Yoo Jung. \"I wonder if that's why it was hard for him. He was such a good person. He really liked students a lot.\" \n", "d5_sg62": "Another student, Kim Hyun Soo, also a freshman, said she felt it was too harsh for Kang to be blamed for what happened on the ferry. \n", "d5_sg63": "\"The vice principal really liked students,\" she said. \"It seems like he was really hard on himself. I don't think anyone should be blaming him.\"\n", "d5_sg64": "His death elicited sorry and sympathy across South Korea.

The terrible grief of the parents, the shocking response of the crew to the unfolding disaster, and the inexorably rising body count.\n", "d7_sg2": "Two days before the South Korean students boarded their ferry for a study trip to the nearby island of Jeju, terrorists broke into a girls' school in Chibok, in the remote state of Borno, in north-eastern Nigeria. They shot guards and abducted about 200 students, who were loaded into trucks and, it seems, taken off into the forest. Two groups of the girls, perhaps 30 in all, managed to escape. The rest have simply disappeared.\n", "d7_sg3": "No one has admitted carrying out the mass kidnapping, although it is assumed to be the work of Boko Haram, the al-Qaida-linked jihadi group. Amnesty International says 1,500 people have been killed this year in the conflict between Boko Haram and Nigerian security forces, more than half of them civilians. The latest bombing by the group was in Abuja, on the same day the girls were abducted, in which at least 70 people died. Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, was soon on the scene. The first appearance of the Borno state governor in Chibok came yesterday, eight days after the attack.\n", "d7_sg4": "The fate of the Nigerian girls, who had been recalled to class in order to sit a physics exam, when all the other schools in the area were closed by security fears, has not been entirely ignored by the world's media. But it has been overwhelmed by the story of the sinking of the Sewol.\n", "d7_sg5": "Some of the reasons for that are obvious. The South Korean story has unfolded on camera, in a first-world country with every facility for news reporting. In contrast, the young Nigerians have vanished into the darkness of a dangerous world.\n", "d7_sg6": "Nigeria is complex and messy and unfamiliar. It is easy to feel that what happens there is not real in the way that what happens on camera in South Korea is real. Watching the images of the almost mad grief of the parents, ready to plunge into the water themselves to find their sons and daughters, is like an awful realisation of one's own worst imaginings.\n", "d7_sg7": "There is no such vivid expression of suffering from Borno, only the grainy images sent on poor satellite links showing the familiar devastation of catastrophe that could come from any of countless news reports. Yesterday, a group of parents pooled resources to buy fuel and set off on their motorbikes into the forest where the security forces dared not go in a last despairing effort to save their daughters \u2013 only to have to turn back as night fell.\n", "d7_sg8": "No one knows what will befall these young women. In February, Boko Haram \u2013 whose founding purpose is to defeat the influence of western education \u2013 murdered 59 students. Teachers, schools and children are in the front line. In Abuja, politicians talk of a decade-long war of containment against jihad to come. But already its objective of peace is being undermined by reports of extra-judicial killings by the military. The insecurity exacerbates the poverty and holds back development.\n", "d7_sg9": "Like the tragedy in South Korea, the crisis in Borno is not some random act of God. It is human made. Yet the loss of the Sewol may result, along with retribution against all of those responsible, in higher standards of seamanship and improvements in ship design. Future lives will be saved. The Seoul government will never again risk being exposed to the humiliation of its failure to protect its own young people.\n", "d7_sg10": "It is much less likely that lessons will be learned from the abduction of the young Nigerian women from their school. The government in Abuja will ship in more soldiers. The west may contribute, as Tony Blair believes is necessary. Maybe in the end some kind of security will be achieved. But in this northern province there is an ancient legacy of Islamic rule \u2013 and high civilisation \u2013 that long predates British imperialism. Many, many innocent people will die first. There is scant interest in nuance, no serious debate about what the rest of the world could do to help. That is the real cost of global inattention.", "d7_sg11": "It may take a while to determine why the South Korean ferry Sewol turned on its side and sank last Wednesday, but already now we know that the image of its captain, Lee Jun-seok, walking to safety even as scores of high school students were struggling desperately for their lives in the capsized hull, has already entered the annals of shame.\n", "d7_sg12": "The duty to put the safety of the travelers entrusted to a captain\u2019s care ahead of his or her own is one of the most enduring traditions of travel on sea, air or land. Yes, it would have taken courage to stay behind and fight to save the young lives for which the captain and crew were responsible \u2014 and there were those who did that. Yet Captain Lee and two-thirds of the crew survived, while two-thirds of the 476 passengers \u2014 325 of whom were 16- and 17-year-old students from the Danwon High School near Seoul off on an excursion \u2014 are dead or missing. The president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye, called it \u201clike a murderous act that can never be understood or forgiven.\u201d\n", "d7_sg13": "Whether Captain Lee could have prevented the capsizing of the ferry had he, and not a junior officer, been on the bridge is another question, one of many. Why did the ship suddenly lurch to one side and begin listing? Why did crewmen fail to order passengers to abandon ship and instead urged them to stay below decks? Why was there such a lack of preparedness? Why did the government take so long to respond to the anguish of parents?\n", "d7_sg14": "These require answers \u2014 and actions. This is not South Korea\u2019s first such accident. In December 1970, the Namyoung sank with 323 fatalities, and, in October 1993, the sinking of the Seohae took 292 lives. The South Koreans will demand far higher safety standards and enforcement.\n", "d7_sg15": "The authorities in other countries should also review their laws and procedures. Many such pledges were made after the Italian cruise ship Costa Concordia struck a rock and was wrecked in the Mediterranean in 2012, with the loss of 32 lives, yet the fate of the Sewol shows that much remains to be done on planning for emergency evacuations. The Costa Concordia, of course, is notorious also for the flight of the captain, Francesco Schettino, before most of the passengers were rescued. Mr. Schettino is currently on trial, charged with causing a shipwreck, manslaughter and abandoning ship. Captain Lee and six crew members of the Sewol have also been arrested. Under South Korean law, abandoning passengers at a time of crisis is punishable by life in prison.", "d7_sg16": "But there's one crew member they are leaving out: Park Jee Young, 22, who by witness accounts helped passengers escape and distributed life jackets -- one after the other to students --  as the stricken ferry began to sink. \n", "d7_sg17": "When she was asked why she wasn't wearing a life jacket, Park said that crew members would be last and that she had to help others first, according to witness accounts to South Korean media.\n", "d7_sg18": "The other day, a man with injuries to his head showed up to the funeral room where Park's memorial stands. \n", "d7_sg19": "When asked by Park's family who he was, the man said that he had been injured in the ferry and that he was \"indebted\" to the young woman who placed a towel on his bloody head and helped him as the water rose.\n", "d7_sg20": "\"She was so responsible and so kind,\" said her grandmother, Choi Sun Dok, 75, who sat on the floor, slumped against a wall, no longer able to stand. Her family members kneeled with her, holding her hand and weeping together on the floor. \n", "d7_sg21": "White mums and lilies, which signify death, poured in from strangers, covering the hallway leading to her memorial room. The flowers contain messages like \"We will not forget your noble spirit.\" \"We will always remember your sacrifice.\" \"Hero.\" An online petition has gone up urging the government to award her a Good Samaritan award. \n", "d7_sg22": "Her relatives say Park wanted to stay in college, but she felt responsible for supporting her family after her father passed away two years ago. So she dropped out and joined the ferry company in 2012. She was transferred to a bigger ship, the Sewol, about six months ago, because she had proved her capabilities, her relatives said.\n", "d7_sg23": "The Sewol's sinking has left many appalled by the alleged actions of several members of the crew -- including the captain, who now faces a series of criminal charges for his role in last week's sinking. \n", "d7_sg24": "\"This is so unfair that our Jee Young had to die while the captain ran away,\" said her aunt, who declined to give her name. \"Jee Young was so responsible, and the captain just ran away.\"\n", "d7_sg25": "Over two-thirds of those on board were students on a high school field trip, many of whom remain missing. \n", "d7_sg26": "Those who are not students, teachers or parents were not allowed on school grounds to allow those to grieve privately. Well-wishers milled outside the school gate, writing Post-it notes and signs with messages of hope and encouragement. \"Brothers and sisters, please come back,\" one read.\n", "d7_sg27": "Judith Ambe, a local college student who knew about 10 of the missing students through her church, stood outside, silently praying. \n", "d7_sg28": "\"I just hope, maybe, they could be found alive,\" Ambe said, wiping her tears. \"I'm hoping God will intervene.\" \n", "d7_sg29": "\"It feels so empty now,\" said student Kim Song Kyum, 17. \"It's not an environment where you can study now.\" \n", "d7_sg30": "\"I want everything to be a lie,\" high school student Oh Hae Youn said. \"When I wake up in the morning, I feel like everything feels right. Then, I realize it's not. I just wish everything was a lie.\"\n", "d7_sg31": "When the HMS Birkenhead, a British ship carrying troops, began to sink off the coast of South Africa in 1852, the captain and military officers on board famously allowed women and children to board the lifeboats first.\n", "d7_sg32": "The captain and many of the troops stayed on the ship until the last, perishing in the ocean as the women and children made their way to safety.  Their chivalrous act of self-sacrifice is considered to have helped set the standard for noble conduct at sea.\n", "d7_sg33": "Other displays of courage by captains and crew members who put their passengers first have punctuated the decades since, like Capt. Edward J. Smith who went down with the Titanic.\n", "d7_sg34": "Capt. Lee Joon-seok of the Sewol, the South Korean ferry that sunk last week, has come under heavy criticism for abandoning the ship while hundreds of passengers remained on board. Dozens of them died and more than 200 were still missing Monday. \n", "d7_sg35": "Lee's actions have prompted comparisons to those of Capt. Francesco Schettino who was in command of the cruise ship Costa Concordia, which crashed into a reef off the Italian coast in 2012, killing 32 people.\n", "d7_sg36": "Witnesses said Schettino jumped into a lifeboat to flee the ship, even though hundreds of passengers were still on board. In his trial, the captain said he fell into a lifeboat when the ship listed sharply.\n", "d7_sg37": "Schettino is now on trial on charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board. He denies wrongdoing.\n", "d7_sg38": "The cases of the Sewol and the Costa Concordia have raised questions about a captain's obligations to passengers when a vessel runs into trouble.\n", "d7_sg39": "By leaving the Sewol soon after it began sinking, Lee reneged on some of his key duties, experts say.\n", "d7_sg40": "\"The captain's first obligation is for the safety of his crew and passengers,\" Capt. James Staples, a maritime consultant, told CNN. \"He should stay on board that vessel until he knows everybody is safely evacuated.\n", "d7_sg41": "\"And then the other reason he stays on board the vessel is for salvage rights. For the captain to leave the vessel in an early situation, it's not the way it should be done.\"\n", "d7_sg42": "An international maritime convention on the safety of life at sea makes a captain responsible for the vessel and all the people on board, but it doesn't stipulate that the captain stay on the ship throughout the crisis.\n", "d7_sg43": "\"You don't necessarily want a captain dying with a ship. But he has a responsibility for the safety of everybody on board that ship,\" said Cade Courtley, former Navy SEAL and president and founder of SEAL Survival.\n", "d7_sg44": "\"He's got to be there and take care of that,\" Courtley told CNN. \"And this guy didn't do that. He was one of the first off. I mean, that's kind of unforgivable, basically.\"\n", "d7_sg45": "And similarly to Schettino in Italy, Lee is facing criminal charges over his role in the disaster, including abandoning his ship, negligence, causing bodily injury and not seeking rescue from other ships.\n", "d7_sg46": "South Korean President Park Geun-hye has likened the actions of Lee and some of the ferry's crew members to murder. \n", "d7_sg47": "As well as the role of honor for captains who went down with their vessels, there is hall of shame for those who jumped ship.\n", "d7_sg48": "In one example, the Italian steamer Sirio was wrecked off the Spanish coast in 1906, killing more than 150 people. \n", "d7_sg49": "Its captain was reported to have abandoned the ship at the first opportunity, but he died the following year of \"a broken heart\" according to a report in The New York Times.\n", "d7_sg50": "Lee has drawn particular criticism for apparently ordering passengers to delay the evacuation of the Sewol as it foundered.\n", "d7_sg51": "\"The captain should have been passing honest and clear information on to everyone as to the situation, not telling them to just sit,\" said William Doherty, a retired captain with the U.S. Merchant Marines.\n", "d7_sg52": "\"It is a fairly fast current area, and the water temperature was cold,\" he said, according to local media. \n", "d7_sg53": "\"I thought that abandoning the ship without discretion would make you drift off a fairly far distance and cause a lot of trouble. At the same time, the rescue ship did not come, and there were no fishing boats or supporting ships around to help at that time.\"\n", "d7_sg54": "Lee's early departure may have exacerbated the crisis on board the ship, said Doherty, who teaches safety management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy.\n", "d7_sg55": "\"When the leadership cuts and runs, it leaves a vacuum that is almost impossible to fill,\" he told CNN.\n", "d7_sg56": "\"There should have been crewmembers going to the life raft stations. There should have been crew members mustering the passengers. So you know your head count. If there are missing people, there should have been other crew members searching the vessel to find those people.\"\n", "d7_sg57": "Although U.S. law doesn't specify abandoning ship as a crime, it's a long-standing tradition that the captain be the last one off a sinking ship, according to legal experts.\n", "d7_sg58": "He cautioned, though, that not all the details have emerged of Lee's actions during the crucial moments on the Sewol.\n", "d7_sg59": "\"We don't know if the coast guard demanded him to get off at that time,\" he said. \"They may have been alongside and told the captain he had to get off at that time.

The boat is sinking.\" The boy's fate was not clear.\n", "d7_sg64": "It was not until three minutes later, the coast guard told CNN, that the ship's crew made a distress call to maritime officials.\n", "d7_sg65": "The revelation is likely to add to questions about the conduct of the crew, nine of whom are facing charges in last week's sinking.\n", "d7_sg66": "Among other things, authorities have questioned why an inexperienced third mate was guiding the ship at the time of the accident, why so few of the ferry's life rafts were deployed and why crew members ordered passengers to don life vests and stay put.\n", "d7_sg67": "At least 146 people are confirmed dead, according to the joint task force leading the search. Earlier, when the death toll was reported to be 128, authorities had said that 174 people were still missing. \n", "d7_sg68": "The death toll had been expected to climb as divers were able to reach the ship's cafeteria, where many passengers were thought to be when the ship began to have troubles last week.
