Many in the armed forces clearly still harbour doubts about Erdo\u011fan, who has sought to undermine secular and military influence since gaining power in 2003.

Thousands of G\u00fclenists have infiltrated the country\u2019s institutions, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s argument goes, and they now need to be weeded out en masse before they can wreak more havoc on the country.\n", "d8_sg10": "How have recent events affected Erdo\u011fan\u2019s popularity?\n", "d8_sg11": "On the night of the attempted coup, all three main opposition parties condemned the rebellion and expressed their support for the elected president.

Despite the presence of radical Ukrainian nationalists, the vast majority of opposition demonstrators in Kiev were ordinary citizens.

The protesters were armed with little more than homemade shields, rubbish helmets and molotov cocktails.\n", "d14_sg39": "In Crimea, by contrast, the shadowy Russian troops are equipped with the latest gear \u2013 they are professionals, not amateur homegrown revolutionaries.

But there is method here too: Russia refuses to recognise Kiev's new pro-western interim government as a legitimate partner. It is likely to continue to treat Yanukovych \u2013 whose regime is accused of plundering $70bn (\u00a342bn) from Ukraine's treasury \u2013 as the head of a government-in-exile. It may even seek to return him to Crimea to continue his \"executive\" functions. Given Yanukovych's love of bling, Crimea's sumptuous Livadia Palace \u2013 where Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill met to discuss Europe's 1945 postwar carve-up \u2013 might serve as his new HQ.\n", "d14_sg43": "Spare a thought, meanwhile, for Crimea's Tartars. They are the peninsula's original Turkic-speaking Muslim inhabitants. Well-educated and politically organised, they now number 300,000, 15% of Crimea's population. They want to remain part of Ukraine. They support Kiev's new pro-EU leadership.\n", "d14_sg44": "They also have their own awful folk memories of Russian colonisation and exile: in 1944, Stalin deported the Tartars and other smaller groups to central Asia.

Its resources are already stretched without having to deal with a strong separatist movement and its even stronger external backer.
