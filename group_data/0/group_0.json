Following the airstrikes, residents reported whole families found dead in their beds, with victims and injured survivors showing symptoms that match poisoning by nerve agents.\n", "d1_sg110": "These symptoms included pupils shrunk to the size of pin pricks, foaming at the mouth, breathlessness and convulsions.\n", "d1_sg111": "Western agencies scramble to obtain samples from Syria chemical attack Read more\n", "d1_sg112": "The most likely poison is thought to be sarin, which killed hundreds in an attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta in 2013. After those deaths the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, agreed to give up his chemical weapons supply for destruction.\n", "d1_sg113": "But a large supply of sarin was allegedly unaccounted for when the stockpile was removed, according to Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of the UK Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment and director of Doctors Under Fire.\n", "d1_sg114": "Even experts who say it is too early to confirm sarin use say the deaths have all the hallmarks of a chemical weapons attack, delivered through airstrikes.\n", "d1_sg115": "\u201cIt is possible it\u2019s sarin but also possible it could be something else, or a mix of things. We mustn\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking that [only] one substance was used, when it could have been more than one,\u201d said Richard Guthrie, a British chemical weapons expert.\n", "d1_sg116": "\u201cThe key thing I\u2019m confident of here is that a material has been deliberately dispersed in order to cause harm. People flying the aircraft wanted to kill other people with poison.\u201d\n", "d1_sg117": "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, whose doctors treated some of the victims, said both a nerve agent and chlorine appeared to have been used.\n", "d1_sg118": "\u201cVictims smelled of bleach, suggesting they had been exposed to chlorine,\u201d the group said in a statement, after detailing symptoms of neurotoxins. \u201cThese reports strongly suggest that victims of the attack on Khan Sheikhun were exposed to at least two different chemical agents.\u201d\n", "d1_sg119": "What is sarin and how does it work?\n", "d1_sg120": "Sarin is a colourless, odourless liquid at room temperature. It can kill in very small doses through contact with the skin or inhalation when it is in vapour form.\n", "d1_sg121": "When used in weapons, it is usually fired in a rocket or shell that on impact disperses the liquid as an aerosol \u2013 a cloud of tiny droplets fine enough to be inhaled or mist the skin and eyes. Some sarin will also evaporate into gas.\n", "d1_sg122": "Once inside the body, Sarin interferes with an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase, which helps control the nervous system. A few drops can be lethal, with children particularly vulnerable, and death can come within minutes.\n", "d1_sg123": "It was first manufactured in 1938 by scientists in Nazi Germany, who were working on pesticides and stumbled across the lethal poison. They passed the recipe to the army and it was loaded into shells although never used against allied forces.\n", "d1_sg124": "The main treatment is injection with a chemical antidote called atropine, which blocks the effect of sarin on the nervous system and can revive victims who appear almost dead. It is in short supply in rebel-held Syria.\n", "d1_sg125": "Rinsing less badly-affected survivors with water can help with decontamination, and oxygen can ease breathing difficulties, but neither can halt the action of sarin or reverse any damage it has caused to nerves.\n", "d1_sg126": "Russia has denied that Syria launched a chemical weapons attack. Does their argument have any credibility?\n", "d1_sg127": "Syria\u2019s military has \u201ccategorically denied\u201d responsibility for the attack. Russia, which is heavily backing the Assad government, said a Syrian government airstrike had hit a \u201cterrorist warehouse\u201d holding \u201ctoxic substances\u201d.\n", "d1_sg128": "That claim does not fit with facts on the ground, for several reasons. An airstrike on a weapons depot with high explosives would have destroyed much of the sarin immediately, and distributed any that survived over a much smaller area.\n", "d1_sg129": "\u201cThe pattern of casualties isn\u2019t right for the distribution of materials that you would get if you had a location with toxic materials breached by an airstrike. It\u2019s more consistent with canisters that have distributed [chemical weapons] over a wider population,\u201d Guthrie said.\n", "d1_sg130": "While it is impossible to assess the exact amount of chemical agent used immediately, the extent and distribution of the casualties are consistent with the use of hundreds of kilos.\n", "d1_sg131": "Sarin is too complicated and expensive for rebels to have manufactured themselves, and while they might potentially have obtained some supplies of stolen nerve agents or other gas, it is very unlikely to be more than a few kilos.\n", "d1_sg132": "\u201cIf they have [sarin], it would be in minute quantities, maybe a kilo or so,\u201d said De Bretton Gordon. The high numbers of woman and children among the casualties was not consistent with a military depot, he added.\n", "d1_sg133": "Finally, the Syrian manufacturing process for sarin involves creating and storing two key components, both far more stable than the nerve agent itself. They are mixed to create sarin hours \u2013 or at most days \u2013 before it is used, said Dan Kaszeta, a chemical weapons expert and former officer in the US Army\u2019s chemical corps.\n", "d1_sg134": "So an airstrike on a storage facility would be unlikely to release sarin itself. And because one of the two components is highly flammable isopropyl alcohol, or rubbing alcohol, you would expect a fireball, which has not been observed.\n", "d1_sg135": "Can anything be done to stop future attacks?\n", "d1_sg136": "Doctors and experts have called for greater supplies of gas masks and the antidote to sarin to be sent to rebel-held areas of Syria to help limit casualties in the case of another attack.\n", "d1_sg137": "That response is in part recognition of the futility of international efforts to limit use of chemical weapons in Syria, after the initial outrage that followed the 2013 attack in Ghouta.\n", "d1_sg138": "Although Assad destroyed much of his stockpile then, there are allegations he kept some supplies. The military also has ready access to chlorine, which can be used as a weapon but is also an industrial chemical needed for peaceful uses, including water purification.\n", "d1_sg139": "After Barack Obama publicly abandoned his \u201cred line\u201d on the use of chemical weapons in Syria, there has been little overt military threat to Assad for deploying powerful and once-taboo weapons against rebel-held areas.\n", "d1_sg140": "There has been no response, other than toothless censure, to UN reports confirming use of chemical weapons by government troops.\n", "d1_sg141": "\u201cChemical weapons are incredibly successful, that\u2019s why Assad is using them,\u201d said de Bretton Gordon. \u201cWhat we need is safe zones, particularly places like Idlib, to protect civilians.\u201d\n", "d1_sg142": "But the Syrian airforce and anti-air defences have always made the prospect of trying to control its skies risky.\n", "d1_sg143": "Russia\u2019s decision in 2015 to double down on military support for Assad would make any attempt to enforce a no-fly safe zone even more dangerous and carry a serious risk of escalation.\n", "d1_sg144": "What does this attack mean for the future of chemical weapons?\n", "d1_sg145": "There is growing concern that increasing deployment of once taboo chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war, with apparent impunity, is eroding decades of work to control their manufacture and use.\n", "d1_sg146": "\u201cIn 2016 we saw the highest frequency of use of chemical weapons since 1916,\u201d said De Bretton Gordon.\n", "d1_sg147": "Chemical weapons have helped Assad hold on to power during a long and brutal civil war, at the cost of immense civilian suffering. The fact that he has faced no real consequences for their use risks setting a dangerous precedent, with implications that carry far beyond Syria, weapons expert Guthrie said.\n", "d1_sg148": "\u201cYou would have expected the use of chemical weapons, as deployed by Assad in 2013, would result in him being deposed by his own people or by the international community.\n", "d1_sg149": "\u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened, so what is the disincentive for a dictator to think, \u2018This is a weapons system that might help me survive.\u2019\u201d", "d1_sg150": "The president, standing alongside King Abdullah II of Jordan at the news conference, told reporters, \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m doing anything one way or the other, but I\u2019m certainly not going to be telling you.\u201d\n", "d1_sg151": "Mr. Trump\u2019s stern words and lack of specifics attested to a leader, 75 days into his presidency, who is determined to show a more muscular style than Mr. Obama but is grappling with many of the same complexities that dogged his predecessor.

The devaluations of 1992 and 2008 encouraged greater capital inflows, especially into residential and commercial property, but also into manufacturing investments.

Previously, a referendum had been scheduled for March 30 on the less politically charged question of whether Crimea should have greater autonomy within Ukraine. \n", "d22_sg331": "If, as expected, a majority endorses secession, the story will change overnight from one about Russia's unprovoked military invasion to one about a minority's right to self-determination. That is the Kremlin's plan.\n", "d22_sg332": "European leaders, already having trouble agreeing on a response to naked aggression, will find it much harder to oppose the popular will of the Crimean people. At that point, risky actions to force Crimea back into Ukraine will become difficult for Western politicians to explain to their own domestic voters. \n", "d22_sg333": "The legal status of the planned referendum is more than murky. Ukrainian acting president Oleksandr Turchynov has called it a \"farce\" and a \"crime against the nation.\" But, for democratic politicians -- and the societies they represent -- going against a majority vote is never easy. \n", "d22_sg334": "If Russia can change the subject in this way, Crimean secession will become an established fact. Putin, who assured journalists on Tuesday that Russia did not mean to annex Crimea, will then be able to claim that he was \"forced to yield to the will of the people.\"\n", "d22_sg335": "With just a few days to turn the situation around, temporizing needs to stop. Allowing Russia \"more time\" at this point, as some European leaders have proposed, is exactly what the West should not do. That Russia's Crimean clients have moved the referendum date forward suggests nervousness in Moscow -- and a recognition that time is of the essence. \n", "d22_sg336": "In the remaining time before March 16, the West must convince both the Kremlin-connected Russian elite and the population of Crimea that the region's secession to Russia would be a mistake. Direct threats are counterproductive, but clearly and calmly articulating the consequences of such a move can produce results. \n", "d22_sg337": "First, all the European Union states plus the United States should make absolutely clear that they will not recognize the results of a referendum held while armed bands of \"self-defense forces\" roam Crimea. Any decision to secede that results from such a referendum will be considered illegitimate. \n", "d22_sg338": "To increase Moscow's isolation, it is worth exploring whether a large majority would support a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly -- of course, Russia would veto in the Security Council -- reasserting the inviolability of borders in this case. \n", "d22_sg339": "Second, the EU and U.S. should announce that economic relations would be frozen between the West and a Crimea in legal limbo following secession. In part, this freeze would be enforced by the markets themselves. \n", "d22_sg340": "Crimea's tourism industry would have to forget about attracting Western visitors to the region's beaches. International investors would demand huge risk premiums. But Western restrictions on investment and trade with Crimea could amplify the effect. The region's agricultural produce could be banned from European and Ukrainian markets. \n", "d22_sg341": "Crimeans must be helped to understand the choice they face: between becoming another Abkhazia -- a failed statelet on intravenous drip from Moscow -- or a flourishing region within the new, broader Europe. The EU should quickly earmark some portion of the 11 billion euros already promised to Ukraine for projects to develop Crimea's economy if it remains Ukrainian. \n", "d22_sg342": "Third, the United States should work out a set of restrictions to place on Russian banks and corporations that do business in a Crimea that has illegally seceded. As economist Anders Aslund has pointed out, existing rules against money laundering could be enforced more rigorously against various Russian entities.  \n", "d22_sg343": "All of this needs to be done rapidly. While Washington has reacted quickly as the crisis unfolded, the EU has suffered from its chronic lack of central decision-making authority. The next few days constitute a test. \n", "d22_sg344": "If Brussels cannot forge a strong, common position in time, then management of future crises will simply revert to the foreign ministries of Germany, France, and Britain, with the EU's foreign policy role narrowed to coordinating long-term policies. \n", "d22_sg345": "While spelling out the costs that threaten the Crimean population and the Russian political elite, Western leaders must continue to devise \"off-ramps\" to outcomes that Putin could conceivably accept, but that, nevertheless, will not be seen as rewarding aggression.\n", "d22_sg346": "The West can call for a significant increase in Crimea's political autonomy within Ukraine, negotiated with Kiev. U.S. and European leaders should also speak out far more audibly in favor of minority language and cultural rights. They should have responded with outrage when the Rada, Ukraine's parliament, canceled the status of Russian as an official language and should now praise the promised veto of this law. \n", "d22_sg347": "It may still be possible to prevent the illegal annexation of Crimea. Putin is sensitive to the danger of splits within his political elite. The West must show him that he has underestimated the extent of political isolation and economic disruption that annexation would cause.
