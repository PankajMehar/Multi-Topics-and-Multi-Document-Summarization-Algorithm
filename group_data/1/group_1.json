It's about promoting a Putinist agenda, and I can tell you firsthand, it's also about bashing America.\" The editorial policy is set by its senior Russian editors. \"Middle-management,\" she said, \"is American, and their role is to make sure we're in line.\"\n", "d20_sg160": "A senior staff member at RT insists the staff decides RT's editorial policy, not the Russian government, and compares RT with the BBC, France 24, Deutsche Welle, and other state-funded news outlets.\n", "d20_sg161": "Russia, that staff member says, must constantly fight the Cold War image of the \"evil Empire,\" and that could take years to overcome. \n", "d20_sg162": "Dmitri Trenin, an expert from the Carnegie Moscow Center who served in the Soviet and Russian military for more than 20 years, says RT's approach differs significantly from news broadcasting in the Soviet Union. \"The Soviet system of propaganda talked about Russia.

If the heavily pro-Russian Crimea were no longer in Ukraine, the pro-Western forces would be substantially stronger in Kiev.\n", "d20_sg199": "Whatever happens in the next few weeks in Crimea, the United States has a very limited tactical ability to affect it.

There are a lot of ethnic Russians in all three countries (and especially in Estonia). They are much closer to Russia than is Crimea -- it is 228 miles from Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, to St. Petersburg. \n", "d20_sg202": "The great difference is that the three Baltic states are members of NATO. Any Russian adventurism in this area could force the enormous choice of either directly confronting Russia in its own neighborhood or allowing NATO to collapse because we are unwilling to meet our treaty obligations.\n", "d20_sg203": "Convincing Putin that we take seriously his toughness and his determination, and we are prepared to meet it, could be a vital step toward avoiding a future disaster.\n", "d20_sg204": "-- First, move to increase the production of oil and gas, thus dramatically lowering the price of oil, thereby cutting into Putin's ability to earn hard currency.\n", "d20_sg205": "-- Second, wean the Europeans off their dependence on Russian natural gas as one of their biggest suppliers, thus lowering Putin's ability to exercise influence over the European community.\n", "d20_sg206": "-- Third, strengthen the ability of Ukraine to produce its own energy so it has both a healthier economy and no longer relies on Putin and Russia as its main source of energy.\n", "d20_sg207": "-- Fourth, strengthen American military capabilities to show that we recognize that Putin is more dangerous than we thought and that we are prepared to strengthen our ability to deal with any threat he might bring to bear, particularly on our NATO allies in the Baltic.\n", "d20_sg208": "The Congress should call on the President to immediately issue an executive order to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which will reduce the price of oil worldwide by getting more oil to market faster.

After all, since the executive order the President issued on Thursday indicates this is \"a national emergency,\" then there are serious things we can do in a national emergency. \n", "d20_sg210": "This President has already proven a willingness to use executive orders widely. This would be one that would weaken and undermine Putin, while also beginning to liberate the Europeans from dependence on Russia. \n", "d20_sg211": "Obama should also immediately open closed offshore and federal land to drill for natural gas and oil. The more oil and gas the United States produces, the further we can drive down costs, leaving the Russians weaker and with fewer resources.\n", "d20_sg212": "There are 24 liquid natural gas projects tied up in the federal bureaucracy. A presidential executive order could liberate them and send the clear signal the United States is prepared to replace Russia as the natural gas supplier of last resort.  This would clearly signal the Europeans that in the next few years they will have an alternative to being blackmailed by Putin.\n", "d20_sg213": "Remember, it was President Reagan's strategy to drive down the price of oil to $11 a barrel that eventually bankrupted the Soviet Union and gave Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev no choice but to sign a series of agreements that recognized the decline of the Soviet Union.\n", "d20_sg214": "If Clinton was both sincere and serious in comparing Putin to Hitler when she related the action in the Crimea to the action that Hitler took in Czechoslovakia  in 1938, then she would be demanding that we dramatically strengthen rather than weaken American defense. \n", "d20_sg215": "The President should announce that he is directing the Joint Chiefs to significantly re-evaluate the budget in order to be more than adequately prepared for any possible contingency. This would send a signal in the real world that the Russians would understand.\n", "d20_sg216": "What we have so far is symbolic liberalism offering words, symbolic liberalism flying around the world from capital to capital having meetings, and symbolic liberalism targeting narrowly a handful of people in a way that will have no impact on Putin. \n", "d20_sg217": "What we could have is serious, robust action that would have a genuine and immediate impact and would weaken Russia's ability to act aggressively toward its neighbors.\n", "d20_sg218": "This is the time to determine, are we serious about confronting Putin over the long run?

But the world can already glean important lessons. Unfortunately, most of those lessons are cause for deep concern. Here are five clear messages from the crisis in Ukraine.\n", "d20_sg247": "1. Nobody's scared of America, but American and European values hold strong appeal.\n", "d20_sg248": "Lest we forget, this all started over a move by the now-deposed Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, who broke his promise to sign a partnership agreement with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Moscow. Ukrainians were enraged, not just because they want more trade with Europe but because they have seen what Western standards can bring to a society.\n", "d20_sg249": "They were fed up with corruption, authoritarianism and stagnation. They wanted their country to be free of Moscow's interference, and many gave up their lives to fight for an ideal of stronger democratic institutions, rule of law and fair play.\n", "d20_sg250": "As strong as the pull of these values is, their principal advocate, the U.S., has lost much of its ability to stare down its foes in support of those who want to institute democratic principles in their countries. We saw it when President Barack Obama declared -- years ago -- that Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad must step down. We saw it when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was pelted with tomatoes in Egypt. And we saw it in Ukraine, when Obama warned Putin to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity, only to see the Russians capture Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. America does not intimidate.\n", "d20_sg251": "Even if Moscow were to relinquish all control of Ukrainian territory today, Putin has already achieved a main goal. He has sent a clear message to countries that were once part of the Soviet Union -- and perhaps to the USSR's former Eastern European satellites -- that they cannot defy his wishes without paying a painful price. In that sense, Putin has won.\n", "d20_sg252": " A top Putin aide warned last summer that Ukraine was risking  \"suicide\" if it dared to defy Moscow. Now we know this was no bluff. Putin is serious about protecting Moscow's sphere of influence. It's not clear how closely he wants to control what are supposed to be independent countries.\n", "d20_sg253": "3. If you are a vulnerable state, you may regret surrendering nuclear weapons.\n", "d20_sg254": "This may be the most dangerous of all the lessons from this crisis. Ukraine had a sizable nuclear arsenal at the end of the Cold War, but it agreed to give it up in exchange for security guarantees. In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine committed itself to dismantling the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. Russia, in exchange, vowed to respect Ukraine's borders and its independence. Now, Russia has clearly violated those commitments.  If Ukraine still had its atomic weapons, Moscow would have thought twice before seizing parts of Ukraine.\n", "d20_sg255": " 4. Don't expect support from all international peace activists (unless the U.S. invades).\n", "d20_sg256": "To liberal activists in Ukraine and Russia, the reaction from international peace movement must be a hard pill to swallow. Parts of Ukraine have been captured at the point of a gun by a regime that actively suppresses dissent. When liberal Russians protested, police arrested hundreds of anti-war demonstrators. \n", "d20_sg257": "While Russia's invasion of Ukrainian territory and its harsh crackdown on local protests have been criticized by some human rights activists, the reaction among some prominent \"peace\" activists has been astonishing. Several have mimicked Putin's line, blaming the U.S. for the crisis. Instead of taking a clear stance in support of a country with invading military forces on its soil, some so-called anti-war groups have taken the opportunity to dust off their anti-American vitriol.\n", "d20_sg258": "A favorite line of discussion is whether Washington has any right to criticize Russia's invasion of Ukrainian territory after the U.S. invaded Iraq, a country that was ruled by one of the world's most brutal, genocidal dictators. However misguided America's Iraq invasion, even drawing the comparison is an insult to Ukrainians.\n", "d20_sg259": "One day, if history moves in the direction we all wish, countries will solve their disputes through diplomacy and negotiation. Sadly, that day has not arrived. John Kerry has expressed dismay at Putin's \"19th-century\" behavior, but power politics, forcible border expansion and brazen aggression have not been relegated to the history books; witness events in places like Syria, the Central African Republic and now in Ukraine. \n", "d20_sg260": "Those are the first five lessons. But allow me to offer a bonus, a work in progress that could join as No. 6: When the stakes grow high enough, the U.S. and Europe may rise to the challenge.\n", "d20_sg261": "Western nations seemed caught off-guard by Putin's \"incredible act of aggression,\" as Kerry termed it. Some of Putin's gains (see No. 2) may be irreversible. But the U.S. and Europe have been shaken up by events, and they may yet send a message of their own, helping Kiev's government succeed and prosper as it sets out to chart a future of its own and limiting Putin's ability to replicate his acts of intimidation. \n", "d20_sg262": "Kerry's visit to Kiev was a powerful moment. His unvarnished message to Putin, if backed by action, was a respectable start. The U.S. would prefer to see this crisis resolved through negotiations, he declared, but if Russia chooses not to do so, Washington's and its partners \"will isolate Russia politically, diplomatically and economically.\"  Already the EU is offering Ukraine an aid package comparable to the one Putin used to lure it away. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel is boosting ties with Poland and the Baltic States, and economic sanctions are under discussion.\n", "d20_sg263": "While hosting CNN's Crossfire this week, I said: \"Republicans are practically cheering for Vladimir Putin today. He's given them a new excuse to bash President Obama.\"  \n", "d20_sg264": "I pointed out that Republicans have been slamming Obama for his handling of the Ukraine crisis even though I have not heard a single, specific way in which they would handle the situation differently. No new ideas, just new insults.  \n", "d20_sg265": "The howls came quickly, and my assertion has been repeatedly attacked and mischaracterized. But the evidence to support it is, troublingly, everywhere. \n", "d20_sg266": "I'm not saying Republicans are pro-Putin or that they want him to invade Ukraine.  But they certainly have \ufffdX conveniently, even gleefully -- found a good way to put Putin's actions to political use at home. Just listen to former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani on Monday: \"Putin decides what he wants to do and he does it in half a day... he makes a decision and he executes it. Quickly. Then everybody reacts. That's what you call a leader.\"  \n", "d20_sg267": "And Sarah Palin: \"People are looking at Putin as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil; they look at our President as one who wears mom jeans and equivocates and bloviates.\" \n", "d20_sg268": "Republican leaders are not only bashing Obama, but appearing to praise Putin.\n", "d20_sg269": "There's more:  Sen. John McCain, R- Arizona, seemed to blame the Ukraine crisis on Obama, telling the American Israel Public Affairs Committee this week, \"this is the ultimate result of a feckless foreign policy in which nobody believes in America's strength anymore.\" \n", "d20_sg270": "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, has weighed in: \"We have a weak and indecisive President that invites aggression,\" as did Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas: \"Emboldened by President Obama's trembling inaction, Vladimir Putin has invaded the Crimea region of Ukraine.\" \n", "d20_sg271": "Listen, there's nothing wrong with criticizing the President's policy positions or actions.  To hold a President's feet to the fire over every aspect of government is the job not only of our elected leaders but of all citizens.  Substantive dissent is indeed patriotic.  But substantive dissent is not what we have here.  We have baseless, petty politics that are ultimately counterproductive to America's global standing. \n", "d20_sg272": "On Saturday, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, published a list of steps he thinks Obama should take to \"punish Russia.\" They included calling Russia's actions an invasion \ufffdX which, um, Secretary of State John Kerry actually did the same day that Rubio made his demand \ufffdX and sending Kerry to Kiev, which was announced a day later. The ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, called for immediate sanctions against Russia--but the Treasury Department under Obama's direction was already drafting a package of stiff sanctions.  \n", "d20_sg273": "Republicans have also called for visa bans for Russian leaders and asset freezes.  Well, on Sunday, Kerry said, \"There could even be, ultimately, asset freezes, visa bans. There could be certainly disruption of any of the normal trade routine. There could be business drawback on investment in the country.\"  He said the major world powers are \"going to isolate Russia\" and \"all options are on the table.\"\n", "d20_sg274": "If the Obama administration is already acting on the initiatives that its Republican critics are demanding in response to the Ukraine crisis, why are they complaining?\n", "d20_sg275": "Because, they allege, it's because Obama has been so weak for five years that Putin thought he could get away with invading Ukraine. Let's look at that argument more closely.\n", "d20_sg276": "In August 2008, Vladimir Putin invaded the Republic of Georgia while George W. Bush was President of the United States. Where were the \"weakness\" complaints from Republicans? Well, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer \ufffdX who has said that in the Ukraine situation Obama's \"inaction created a vacuum\" and who derided the President's statements on Ukraine as \"weak\" \ufffdX said of the Georgia invasion back in 2008, \"Well, obviously it's beyond our control. The Russians are advancing. There is nothing that will stop them.\"  \n", "d20_sg277": "Conservative Heritage Foundation national security staffer Peter Brookes exuded a similar calm in 2008: \"There's no easy answer; there's only tough choices... Russia is a tough nut to crack.\"  Apparently when a Democrat is president the situation is much simpler. Last Friday, Brookes explained that the Russian invasion of Crimea is proof that \"this administration's policy toward Russia has been a failure.\"  Hmmm....\n", "d20_sg278": "There's another aspect to this Republican hypocrisy.  McCain recently called Obama \"the most naive president in history\" because of his foreign policy tactics.  And yet it was George W. Bush who famously said, upon meeting Putin, \"I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straight forward and trustworthy, and we had a very good dialogue.  I was able to get a sense of his soul.\"  Did Republicans find him \"weak\"? \"Naive\"? \n", "d20_sg279": "Contrast this with Obama, who, against considerable odds, wrangled Russia into a constructive role on Iran sanctions, Syrian chemical weapons removal and a new START treaty.  It is not merely laughable to call this President, who has unfortunately expanded the use of drone warfare and who also ordered the mission to kill Osama bin Laden, \"weak.\"  It is also self-destructive to our national interest, since absent any substantive disagreements, it reveals only national disunity in the face of a global crisis. \n", "d20_sg280": "It's what Republicans might call -- if the other party were doing it \ufffdX poor leadership.", "d20_sg281": "As so often happens in big international confrontations, Ukraine is devolving into a complicated mess from which no one has yet outlined a reasonable retreat acceptable to all sides.  Russia did not push into Crimea just to put its tanks in reverse and go home. The Ukrainian government can't very well tolerate a land grab within 400 miles of Kiev.  And the big Western powers, including the United States, have raised so many threats and objections, they will look weak, dishonest, or both if nothing is done now.  \n", "d20_sg282": "So let's sort through some options as laid out by many of our expert analysts on CNN. \n", "d20_sg283": "1) Going to the guns: This is a good one to dispense with first, because no one wants it.  Ukraine, absent massive and sustained outside help, would be decimated by the Russian bear.  The Russians are better trained, better equipped and better funded.  By virtue of geography and their superior navy, they would start the fight with Ukraine 60% encircled by hostile forces.  But Russia has reason to keep the pistols holstered, too.  Turning eastern Ukraine into a battlefield would disrupt critical industry, agriculture, and oil and gas sales in the region for years.  Also, a pitched battle could draw in other players, and then the whole World War III discussion lights up.\n", "d20_sg284": "2) Russia retreats:  Unlikely.  They didn't steam into Crimea just for a getaway weekend.  The Russians have important assets to protect there, and that does not necessarily mean the 60% of the Crimean population that grew up speaking Russian.  The vaunted Black Sea Fleet counts on its Sevastopol port for year-round access (via Istanbul) to the warm waters of the Mediterranean.  Arguably, the fear of losing that route to an unfriendly Ukrainian government is what drove Russia to take Crimea in the first place.   \n", "d20_sg285": "Leaked call raises questions about who was behind sniper attacks in Ukraine\n", "d20_sg286": "3) Russia retreats with some conditions:  More likely.  What conditions?  Crimean leaders have already voted to leave Ukraine and rejoin Russia which was home until 1954, when Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine.  Crimean voters will have a chance to ratify or reject this decision in the next couple of weeks, even as Kiev says they have no right to redraw the national borders.  In any event, this is one possibility: Crimea becomes a part of Russia, or a semi-independent nation with great affection for Russia (read: a puppet state ready to do whatever Moscow wants). Or Russia gets a permanent agreement to turn Sevastopol into Russian territory, like the arrangement the United States has with Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. No matter how that plays out, Russia denies ever having designs on all of this -- even as the mysterious troops in the peninsula melt away, the rest of the world grumbles, and Ukraine goes back to trying to pay its debts.\n", "d20_sg287": "4) Russia advances:  Not content with Crimea and eager to show Kiev just who they are messing with, the Russians storm across the border and take much of eastern Ukraine.  No one knows if this is in Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans, but if it happens ... see option No. 1. \n", "d20_sg288": "5) The Western world turns on the squeeze play:  The White House appears to want a unified effort in which nations all over the globe use their political and economic might to punish Russia and leave the new Ukrainian government triumphant.  Problem is, several big countries seem reluctant to take that course, and unless everyone is on the same page, any sanctions would be weakened.  And even though it was hit hard in 2008 by the recession, Russia is not Syria, Iran, or North Korea.  This is a big nation that is unlikely to buckle quickly to any amount of pressure.\n", "d20_sg289": "The takeaway: There are plenty of other possibilities, but conventional wisdom says these are the most likely options at the moment.  The biggest danger?  Everyone is wrong ... and some unforeseen, uncontrolled options arise, making the situation not better, but even worse.  \n", "d20_sg290": "READ: Anchor quits: I can't be part of network 'that whitewashes' Putin's actions\n", "d20_sg291": "Anchor quits: I can't be part of network 'that whitewashes' Putin's actions\n", "d20_sg292": "Another member of state-funded Russia Today made waves on Wednesday -- not by standing behind Moscow, as the news network is wont to do, but by bucking it.\n", "d20_sg293": "From the anchor chair, Liz Wahl closed a show -- as seen in video which she later tweeted -- talking about the \"ethical and moral challenges\" she faces working for Russia Today, also known as RT.

Putin -- the leader of a democracy, albeit a highly corrupt and politically stagnant one -- simply meddles in the affairs of countries that could reasonably be said to fall within his country's historical sphere of influence. Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union until two decades ago (whereas Crimea was part of Russia until 1954), the country contains millions of ethnic Russians and, crucially, it has Russian military installations that are key to Russia's strategic interests. \n", "d20_sg392": "In other words, a Russian invasion of Ukraine is not going to be a stepping stone to the invasion of France.

Worse, still, is that such provocative language should be applied to a confrontation with a state like Russia. \n", "d20_sg394": "We are dealing with a major power with nuclear weapons that has the capacity to reduce the world to so much irradiated ash.

The US defines missiles this way: intercontinental missiles have a range of more than 5,500 kilometers; intermediate-range missiles have a range of 3,000 to 5,000 kilometers; medium-range missiles have a range of 1,000 to 3,000 kilometers; and short-range missiles have a range of up to 1,000 kilometers. Ballistic missiles are fired on a lofted trajectory, usually going outside the Earth's atmosphere. The missiles can be tipped with warheads, either nuclear weapons, conventional explosives or chemical agents.\n", "d31_sg12": "Ballistic missile defense systems are designed to intercept enemy missiles before they reach a target. THAAD -- or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense -- is a ground-based radar and missile system designed to intercept ballistic missiles on their descent. Aegis, operated from US Navy as well as Japanese warships, is designed to kill enemy missiles mid-flight. Aegis and THAAD use kinetic, non-explosive energy to stop a missile, essentially like a bullet hitting a bullet. Patriot systems are designed to shoot down missiles at closer range than THAAD or Aegis.\n", "d31_sg13": "A live-fire drill means the military units involved are using real ammunition during the exercise rather than simulating the combat experience. Unilateral drills are carried out by one country or branch of service. Combined drills are carried out by more than one country or branch of service.\n", "d31_sg14": "Hydrogen bombs, or H-bombs use fusion, the same process that powers the sun. In a hydrogen (thermonuclear) bomb, \"heavy\" isotopes of hydrogen are forced together to release a much bigger punch -- hundreds or even thousands of times more powerful than the only nuclear weapons that have been used in warfare. Atomic bombs use a process called fission. They split plutonium and/or uranium into smaller atoms in a chain reaction that releases massive amounts of energy. The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, at the end of World War II were atomic bombs."}, "steamming": {"d0_sg0": ["japan", "announce", "friday", "impose", "unilateral", "sanction",
