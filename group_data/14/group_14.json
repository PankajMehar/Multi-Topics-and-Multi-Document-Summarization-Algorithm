Hardliners insisted that running candidates meant implicitly accepting Madrid\u2019s authority and acknowledging that the Catalan republic had been stillborn.

The latest polls suggest pro-independence parties could control the legislature again, if they are once more willing to put their battles with Madrid ahead of all other political priorities. The last separatist coalition brought together groups ranging from Puigdemont\u2019s own centre-right party to the radical left CUP (Popular Unity Candidacy).

What we have instead are two levels of democracy in Spain: you can be a pro-independence party, but only if you do not rule. You will be charged with rebellion if you comply with your electoral commitment. And if you are against independence but you lack a parliamentary force to govern, the almighty state will come to your defence.\n", "d59_sg7": "The Spanish judicial system has its own, particularly serious, shortcomings.

Finally, a judge in Madrid ordered eight members of the deposed Catalan government to be remanded in custody pending possible charges of rebellion, sedition and embezzlement of funds, among others.\n", "d61_sg1": "These events have aroused controversy in the sphere of European public opinion and garnered Madrid some criticism for its handling of the crisis. However, most analyses lack understanding of the movement behind the Catalan drive for independence, namely Catalan nationalism.

It\u2019s one of the highest-income regions in Spain, representing about a fifth of its GDP. Catalans are more educated and have lower unemployment than the Spanish average. Since 1977, Catalans have enjoyed a regional government vested with extensive powers in tax matters, education, public services and foreign representation, and they use and promote their own language to the point of marginalising Castilian, which happens to be the most widely spoken language in Catalonia.\n", "d61_sg4": "Q&A Why does the Spanish government say the Catalan referendum is illegal? Show Hide The Spanish government argues that any referendum on Catalan independence would be illegal because the country\u2019s 1978 constitution makes no provision for a vote on self-determination. The Spanish constitutional court, which has suspended the referendum law pushed through the Catalan parliament in September, is looking into whether the law breaches the constitution. In March this year, the former Catalan president Artur Mas was banned from holding public office for two years after being found guilty of disobeying the constitutional court by holding a symbolic independence referendum three years ago.\n", "d61_sg5": "Although regional institutions were suspended from 1938 to 1977, Catalan bourgeois elites have displayed remarkable survival instincts, entering into alliances with the forces of the Spanish right whenever they deemed it necessary to maintain order. Catalan conservative nationalists have ruled the region for more than three decades in the democratic period. These same nationalists have voted in favour of about half of the national budgets during this period. If changes are to be made in Spain\u2019s federal structure, they shouldn\u2019t be based upon the false assumption that Catalonia has had no role in national politics.\n", "d61_sg6": "It is worth reminding ourselves of which Catalans have had a role in Spanish politics. It has been, overwhelmingly, the Catalan elites, which brings us to another important detail: Catalan nationalism is neither inclusive nor progressive.

To date, projects involving Chinese investors have \u201coften\u201d been \u201copposed on environmental grounds, or because of their impact on local communities and indigenous groups,\u201d writes Ellis, citing the Chone dam project and Mirador mine in Ecuador, the Belo Monte dam in Brazil, the Rio Blanco mine in Peru, the Lupe mine in Mexico, a soy processing facility in Rio Negro in Argentina, the Agua Zarca dam project in Honduras, and the River Magdalena in Colombia as examples.\n", "d97_sg6": "3 Opposition to Chinese projects on environmental grounds is \u201clikely to expand in the future because of the number of potential projects. . . that involve environmentally sensitive areas.\u201d These include plans to develop Goat Island, Jamaica, into an \u201cinternational shipping hub\u201d and the exploitation of the Ishpingo, Tambococha and Tiputini (ITT) oil fields in the far east of the Yasun\u00ed National Park in Ecuador where Ellis says the \u201cChinese corporations who have already done the exploratory drilling are the leading contenders\u201d to win contracts. Indeed, Ellis states that although \u201cno official link\u201d exists between ITT and the construction of a new refinery on Ecuador\u2019s Pacific coast, \u201ca senior Ecuadorian source speaking off-the-record suggested that the granting of the rights for ITT may be a condition pursued by the Chinese for the funding of the Refinery. . . which would be fed by the petroleum extracted there.\u201d\n", "d97_sg7": "4 Environmental concerns are a major challenge for Chinese companies not because they are \u201cinherently less respectful of the environment\u201d than others, but \u201cbecause of a confluence of factors\u201d including the high environmental impacts of the sectors they are focusing on, a \u201ccultural distance\u201d between Chinese and Latin American people, and Chinese companies\u2019 lack of experience in the region. One example: \u201cChinese executives and managers often presume that local authorities will be able to force local residents to comply with decisions to relocate their homes. . . and may mistakenly presume that, as long as they have reached an agreement with the appropriate government authorities, the local communities and other actors will comply with the decisions.\u201d\n", "d97_sg8": "5 \u201cEnvironmental complaints\u201d have already been made about various ongoing Chinese projects.

Official results showed Catalonia\u2019s separatist parties once again winning a narrow majority in the region\u2019s Parliament \u2014 as they had before \u2014 an outcome that could allow them to revive their independence drive.", "d104_sg4": "Story highlights Pro-independence parties won 70 seats in the election, enough to form a coalition government\n", "d104_sg5": "Ciudadanos (Citizens) that is anti independence, became the largest party in Parliament with 37 seats\n", "d104_sg6": "(CNN) The day after elections in Catalonia deepened the split between its separatist parties and the Spanish government, both sides are in a defiant mood.\n", "d104_sg7": "The elections gave the three pro-independence parties a slight majority in the regional Parliament, underscoring the resilience of their vote after three months of upheaval.

Mariano Rajoy\u2019s government wanted to nip the independence mood in the bud. Instead, parties that favour independence have been returned with a narrow majority in the new Catalan parliament in spite of, and perhaps because of, the jailing and exile of key leaders. Yet the result is hardly a triumph for these parties, which although winning 70 of the 135 seats, had the backing of only 47.5% of the votes in a very high turnout. There is no mandate for Catalan independence there. But there is no mandate for the status quo either.\n", "d105_sg1": "Both sides behaved provocatively in the course of the crisis. While Madrid dug in against change, the separatists called an illegal referendum which voted overwhelmingly for independence on 1 October, with a majority of Catalans boycotting the poll. Mr Rajoy\u2019s government overreacted, using violence against voters and imposing direct rule that triggered the jailing of political leaders. It is not surprising that his party saw its vote fall by half this week.\n", "d105_sg2": "Yet nor is it surprising that the big surge in the election was for the more centrist unionist party Citizens, which came top of the poll. The party\u2019s leader, In\u00e9s Arrimadas, seems unlikely to form a new government. But those who do so would be wise to learn from her success in such polarised times. This is a new situation and a new opportunity.\n", "d105_sg3": "If the two sides are wise, they will use this week\u2019s result to wipe the slate clean to allow parliamentary politics to resume. The Madrid government should revoke direct rule and ensure an amnesty for jailed and exiled Catalan leaders, including Carles Puigdemont. But the separatists should accept that the 1 October independence vote is null and void. The two sides must negotiate \u2013 in Spain \u2013 to agree a richer form of devolution for Catalonia that celebrates Spain\u2019s diversity of identities. Some militants on both sides will be obdurate, but the lesson of this week is that a principled compromise is what the situation now requires.", "d106_sg0": "When Spain\u2019s prime minister Mariano Rajoy decided to impose direct rule over Catalonia in October, and call a snap election to replace its regional parliament \u2013 after it had declared independence from Spain \u2013 he thought he was \u201crestoring normality\u201d to Catalan politics and putting an end to the conflict.\n", "d106_sg1": "Instead, the election has shown that conflict is the new normal.

Rajoy\u2019s gamble has certainly backfired. It could be argued that he didn\u2019t have much choice, once the Catalan parliament had broken the law. And the move did defuse the declaration of independence. But the idea that it would permanently resolve the crisis was predicated on an assumption that is very popular in Spain but is wrong: that there is a \u201chidden pro-Spain majority\u201d in Catalonia, which has never been allowed to express itself at the polls, cowed by the prevailing nationalist atmosphere.\n", "d106_sg4": "Play Video 0:48 \u2019A slap in the face\u2019 for Madrid: Puigdemont hails Catalonia election win \u2013 video\n", "d106_sg5": "If only \u2013 the argument went \u2013 there could be an election with the central government in control instead of the nationalist-led one, a different Catalonia would emerge.

The obvious course of action would be a dialogue, but that is still not on the cards. Puigdemont would not settle for anything less than independence or a legally binding referendum. Rajoy says the constitution does not allow it, which is true. Changing the constitution, if there were the will to do so, is a daunting task.\n", "d106_sg9": "The majorities that are needed \u2013 including an all-Spain referendum on the reform \u2013 make it almost impossible.

But not even at Christmas does that seem likely.\n", "d106_sg10": "For now, we\u2019re left with what has been the main driver of this conflict for five years: fate. Both sides seem to put all their trust in theirs. Puigdemont may have won a majority, but he knows he must return to Catalonia to be pronounced president, and then he will be arrested and sent to jail. He certainly hopes the ensuing international scandal will help him out. He shouldn\u2019t count on that. Half his government has already been jailed without the international community uttering a whisper.\n", "d106_sg11": "Even in Catalonia the reaction has been surprisingly muted. The main asset of the Catalan movement has always been its ability to mobilise hundreds of thousands of supporters on the streets. Now the quiet imposition of direct rule has shown that to be a paper tiger, at least for now. Puigdemont can only hope to resist, but not to win.\n", "d106_sg12": "Catalonia election - in pictures Read more\n", "d106_sg13": "As for Rajoy, he may stick to the orthodoxy of the law and hope things will change, his trademark strategy. To be fair, it has worked for him many times. But in this case, it means worsening the surreal situation in Catalan politics. In the absence of a political initiative, the judges will continue to treat the nationalist movement as a \u201crebellion against the state\u201d, an obvious exaggeration.\n", "d106_sg14": "This will inevitably result in the jailing of the Catalonia government, many of its MPs and perhaps dozens of other leaders, who will be given decades-long prison terms. Even Europe, which has remained unquestionably on Rajoy\u2019s side, may begin to ask questions. But then, if both sides have chosen to let fate decide, they will have to live with its verdict.
