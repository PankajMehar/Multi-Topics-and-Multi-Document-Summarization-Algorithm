Various justifications have been offered, from lists of the practical benefits of past discoveries that seemed useless when they were made, to the metaphysical notion that the better we understand our universe, the better we understand ourselves.\n", "d5_sg1": "All true, of course. But does science, or knowledge, really need a justification? It is hard to imagine that any man or woman since the dawn of intelligent life has not gazed out at the sky on a moonless night, wondering how it came to be and what is our place in this vast and wondrous firmament. And each time science has advanced our understanding of those countless dots of light, it has uncovered more mysteries, more questions. The curiosity of our species knows no bounds; more remarkably, neither does our capacity for satisfying it. And that is truly wonderful in itself, even if it doesn\u2019t lead to a better toaster.\n", "d5_sg2": "Photo\n", "d5_sg3": "Briefly, after much trial and error and various earlier incarnations, scientists constructed two mammoth antennas, one in Washington State and the other in Louisiana, designed to detect evidence of the space-time gravitational waves predicted a century ago by Albert Einstein. And so they did, on Sept. 14, in the form of a simple chirp created by the waves that, as the Times science reporter Dennis Overbye put it, \u201cseems destined to take its place among the great sound bites of science, ranking with Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s \u201cMr. Watson \u2014 come here\u201d and Sputnik\u2019s first beeps from orbit.\u201d\n", "d5_sg4": "Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

It strongly bolsters Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity and it potentially changes the shape of scientific inquiry into the next century, opening whole new fields of astronomical observation. It testifies to the ingenuity and perseverance of the physicists who designed the equipment, and it vindicates an investment of about $1.1 billion over 40 years by the National Science Foundation.\n", "d5_sg6": "By coincidence, at about the same time that the LIGO discovery was announced, the House passed a bill requiring that National Science Foundation grants be justified \u201cin the national interest.\u201d It is doubtful that LIGO would have survived such political meddling. The bottom line is that whatever else it may be or lead to, the story of the chirp heard round the universe is simply cool.
