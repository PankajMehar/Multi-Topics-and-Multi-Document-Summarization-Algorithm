Peasant hairstyles, cheap clothes, corralled into concrete dormitories and marched, military style, into and out of the factory. But labour shortages, rising skill levels and better wages have changed the sociology of the Chinese factory. Now it\u2019s spiky hair and, in their leisure time, fast fashion. Though many still live in dorms, taking most of their meals in the factory canteen, since the mid-2000s, many of the industrial districts have had estates of family apartments.\n", "d0_sg1": "This year, there has been a rash of strikes in the Chinese export industry \u2013 headlined by the strike of 30,000 shoe workers at Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings, in Dongguan, southern China. Two factors make conditions ripe. There is a labour shortage, with better jobs available in the service sector. At the same time, a slowing economy is forcing managers to try to claw back certain perks and benefits; at Yue Yuen, it was the underpayment of contributions to a retirement fund that sparked the trouble.\n", "d0_sg2": "But now there\u2019s a third factor at work: the internet, which has exploded into Chinese life. Workers at Yue Yuen used two popular messaging apps to get each other out on strike. He Yuan-Chiang, a lawyer who represents workers in Shenzhen, talked me through the process: \u201cThey used QQ \u2013 an instant messaging service \u2013 to create numerous overlapping groups. These were quite diverse, and often contradicted each other, but everybody could join. But the real organising was done on Weixin.\u201d\n", "d0_sg3": "Weixin is a mobile messaging service similar to WhatsApp in the west. It is zonal \u2013 so you can search for people you know nearby. But its attraction for the strikers was that theycould create invite-only groups there. \u201cThat\u2019s where the core organisers were,\u201d says He. On top of that, the strikers used Weibo \u2013 a service similar to Twitter \u2013 to disseminate news about the strike.\n", "d0_sg4": "Though the strike was settled, its significance has not been lost on China\u2019s government. In an industrial landscape that often looks more like the 19th than the 21st century, the internet is rapidly changing workplace dynamics.\n", "d0_sg5": "In the late 2000s, internet penetration leapt from 10% to 30% in four years. Internet cafes with hundreds of screens opened up in the workers\u2019 districts. Sociologists who interviewed the young migrant workers back then found them using the web for two things: to build connections with other workers from their home towns, and to let off steam by playing games.\n", "d0_sg6": "It\u2019s hard to imagine, if you\u2019ve not been inside the regimented and stressful atmosphere of a Chinese factory, what an internet cafe first felt like to someone who has only ever slept on a farm or in a factory dorm. \u201cOur foreman is a tough guy. But when I meet him in the internet cafe I am not afraid of him,\u201d one female worker told researchers in 2012. \u201cHe has no right to control me here. He is an internet user. So am I.\u201d\n", "d0_sg7": "But that now feels like prehistory. We\u2019ve got the mobile internet \u2013 which has been bigger than the desktop internet in China for two years and involves more than 600 million people. On top of that there is social media. With a combination of Weibo, QQ and Weixin you\u2019ve got the atmosphere of the internet cafe in your pocket.\n", "d0_sg8": "The group messaging service allows you a better chance of hiding your already heavily coded and euphemistic strike calls behind a surge of information too big even for the thousands of internet police to find.\n", "d0_sg9": "Now, on top of technology and a changed economic situation, there is the example of Occupy Central. This peaceful mass movement for democracy in Chinese-administered Hong Kong has brought hundreds of thousands to the streets, mobilised different sections of society, and used the same tools \u2013 internet, social media and occupied space \u2013 as the horizontal movements in Europe and the US. \u201cChina is different\u201d, the perennial excuse of Sinologists for the population\u2019s failure to rebel against Communist party rule, looks hollow since Occupy Central began.\n", "d0_sg10": "It is not clear how much people inside mainland China know about Occupy Central. But at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong last year, students organised a mild, mainly cultural response to it \u2013 printing T-shirts with the slogan \u201cNot only birds are free\u201d and launching discussions around related issues. The students involved included some who had previously been factory workers \u2013 and who were now involved in advocacy work for factory workers in mainland China.\n", "d0_sg11": "At the very least, we can assume the worlds of Occupy Central and the world of the Guangdong province factory workers are not hermetically separated.\n", "d0_sg12": "In the 1990s, when the Chinese government was still dealing with the remnants of an old, industrial, relatively privileged working class, concentrated in heavy industries, worker unrest was treated as tantamount to treason. The initial years of rapid expansion brought chaos and brutality. But before long, official Chinese unions began to organise the migrant workforce, and workers were given basic legal rights. This \u201cnormalisation\u201d of labour relations is not threatened by the outbreak of strikes this year. But information technology injects a new dynamic.\n", "d0_sg13": "In the west, the phenomenon of the networked individual began in San Francisco and spread via the middle classes to the tech-savvy youth. Manual workers, and trade unions, were relatively late to the game. In China, you have a factory workforce with harsh, hierarchical conditions and very little free time, accessing their devices in toilet breaks or on the train home. The contrast between hierarchy at work and the relative freedom of the internet is stark.\n", "d0_sg14": "China is now experiencing 21st-century conflicts over what look like 19th-century issues: poverty, sweated labour, corrupt management. There is one bulletin board, for example, that specialises only in anonymously submitted photographs of Communist bureaucrats wearing luxury watches.\n", "d0_sg15": "If this was only about factory workers versus corrupt bosses, the implications would be interesting but not dramatic. But if you accept that the main faultline in the world is between networks and hierarchies, then China is sitting right on top of it. And China\u2019s workers \u2013 who look like digital rebels, but analogue slaves \u2013 are right at the heart of the phenomenon.\n", "d0_sg16": "Paul Mason is economics editor at Channel 4 News.

Tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents \u2013 young and old, rich and poor \u2013 have peacefully occupied major thoroughfares across the city, shuttering businesses and bringing traffic to a halt. They claim that Beijing reneged on an agreement to grant them open elections by 2017, and demand \u201ctrue universal suffrage\u201d. Organisers said on Monday that the protest would not end until Beijing changes its electoral guidelines and Leung Chun-Ying, the city\u2019s pro-Beijing chief executive, steps down. Neither side seems prepared to back off, and nobody knows how the standoff will end.\n", "d16_sg19": "How this happened\n", "d16_sg20": "Hong Kong, a former British colony of 7 million people, has been governed under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework since it was handed back to Chinese control in 1997. The principle is simple in theory \u2014 Beijing is responsible for the city\u2019s defence and foreign affairs; Hong Kong enjoys limited self-governance and civil liberties, including an independent judiciary and unrestricted press.\n", "d16_sg21": "Its top political post \u2013 that of chief executive \u2013 is chosen by a \u201cnominating committee\u201d of 1,200 people, most of them from pro-Beijing elites. Yet when Beijing regained control over the city, it promised that the region would be able to elect its top leader by universal suffrage by 2017. The group guiding the current protests \u2013 set up 18 months ago by two professors and a baptist minister under the banner Occupy Central with Love and Peace \u2014 threatened to paralyse the city\u2019s central business district if Beijing broke its word.\n", "d16_sg22": "Facebook Twitter Pinterest A student protester rests next to a defaced cut-out of Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Leung Chun-Ying.

Top Communist party officials have put their full weight behind the proposal for committee-vetted candidates, and have shown no sign that they\u2019ll be willing to heed protesters\u2019 demands. Above all, Beijing fears that the city, if left to its own devices, would choose a pro-democratic candidate, potentially planting the seeds for a movement to break away from mainland control. And for a leadership already grappling with separatist movements in the western regions Tibet and Xinjiang, any sort of successful independence movement would set an unthinkable precedent.\n", "d16_sg27": "Relations with Beijing\n", "d16_sg28": "The civil disobedience campaign is about more than open elections \u2013 it\u2019s about the future of the city\u2019s relationship with Beijing. Hong Kong residents say that over the past few years, the central government has been slowly and systematically tightening its grip over the city, leading them to feel politically marginalised and economically squeezed. Real estate markets have flooded with mainland money, making home ownership prohibitively expensive. Local media outlets have begun to rigorously self-censor, for fear of losing advertisers.

Nobody wants to see a repeat of 4 June 1989, when Beijing dispatched the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) to open fire on peaceful pro-democracy protesters. The PLA maintains a garrison in Hong Kong, but Leung said in a televised address on Monday morning that the Hong Kong government would not call in the troops. Chinese state media has also emphasised the central government\u2019s confidence in Hong Kong authorities to deal with the protests themselves. That said, the protests continue to escalate, and Beijing seems ready to stand its ground, no matter what the cost.\n", "d16_sg32": "The view from the mainland\n", "d16_sg33": "While the blanket censorship makes it difficult to assess public sentiment towards the protest (state media has taken a hardline on the protests and censors blocked or scrubbed clean social media, mainland citizens have responded to past Hong Kong demonstrations with a mixture of puzzlement, envy and disdain. Similar protests on the mainland would be unthinkable \u2013 even organisers of seemingly benign demonstrations are subject to extreme intimidation, even prosecution.

I better get a bag ready for jail.\"\n", "d34_sg112": "Indeed many feel that the effects of the sanctions could be felt as strongly inside Russia as outside. Some with knowledge of the Kremlin said that such strong measures were misguided and likely to backfire.\n", "d34_sg113": "\"The solution is not sanctions but intensified communication to avoid worsening of the crisis. Sanctions will only worsen it,\" said Gleb Pavlovsky, a spin doctor who formerly advised the Kremlin. \"They will have no positive influence on Russian policy; instead they will be used in Russian propaganda, and be used for another reason of attack on liberal opposition.\"\n", "d34_sg114": "Timchenko and Arkady Rotenberg saw US sanctions as \"recognition of their service to the Russian state,\" an associate told Interfax on Thursday night, but such bluster is likely to mask great concern over the potential implications, especially if US bans are backed up by similar measures from the EU.\n", "d34_sg115": "Fyodor Lukyanov, a top Russian foreign policy analyst, said that the sanctions were symbolic but important: \"Of course these are very significant figures that belong to a small group that's pretty close to Putin. I don't think they have assets in the US, a year and a half ago Putin started to say that officials should return assets, these people in the inner circle probably listened to him. They probably anticipated such a development in this conflict. So there won't be any direct harm to them. But it's a huge gesture showing that the US administration is resolute on this and prepared to take things further.\"\n", "d34_sg116": "The question now is what exactly the Kremlin can do to retaliate. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told RIA Novosti that Russia viewed the US sanctions with \"bewilderment\" and said that the US would \"not have to wait long\" for a retaliatory response.\n", "d34_sg117": "This followed quickly, with a list of US politicians banned from entrance into Russia.\n", "d34_sg118": "But the reciprocal sanctions that Moscow can issue against the likes of John McCain look weak at best.

Shots were fired, the young men were hit.\n", "d34_sg123": "The encounter appears to confirm the Kremlin's version of the Ukraine crisis. According to its scenario, ultra-nationalists seized power in Kiev last month, compelling Moscow to \"protect\" Crimea and its Russian majority. Meanwhile, fascists have been attacking ethnic Russians in the south and east of Ukraine, close to the Russian border, especially in the febrile Russian-speaking eastern cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk, it says.\n", "d34_sg124": "The big question is whether such confrontations in eastern Ukraine will prompt further Russian \"protective\" measures.

At the same time, however, Peskov explicitly warned that Moscow reserved the right to \"protect Russians and Ukrainians\" there if the situation gets worse.\n", "d34_sg125": "According to civil rights groups, however, the Kremlin's account of anti-Russian persecution is a dark fairytale \u2013 \"entirely fictional\", as one put it. It is, they say, a made-up scenario scripted in Moscow for state TV, and now played out on the ground by pro-Russian activists and bussed-in professionals.

Zakharov said support for the idea of Kharkiv following Crimea and joining Russia was low \u2013 15% according to the latest survey.

The idea is to give the false impression that Russians are being humiliated and Kharkiv wants union with Russia,\" he said.\n", "d34_sg127": "Kharkiv is Ukraine's second biggest city. It is home to more than 1.5 million. Between 1917 and 1934 it was the capital of Soviet Ukraine. With its vast cobbled square, sweeping neo-classical Stalinist architecture, and tank and aviation works, Kharkiv has something of the feel of a communist theme park. But it is also a cosmopolitan centre of learning. It has a university and thousands of students, including some from western Ukraine. There is a towering cathedral, now used as a concert hall, and an oligarchic hotel.\n", "d34_sg128": "Zakharov said the debate in the heady days following Ukraine's revolution was about what to do with Lenin's statue. Supporters of the pro-European Maidan movement in Kiev had been gathering in the park next to a rival monument to Taras Shevchenko, Ukraine's national poet. As events reached fever pitch in Kiev, they moved to the square with a view to dismantling Lenin. They daubed him in graffiti. Quickly, however, anti-Maidan protesters defended the statue, with tents and a vigil. Their counter-symbol was an orange-and-black ribbon; it marks the Soviet 9 May Victory Day over fascism.\n", "d34_sg129": "Wounded supporters of Ukraine's new government after clashes with pro-Russian protesters.

According to Zakharov, these pan-Ukrainian rallies were carefully co-ordinated. In Kharkiv \"20 to 40 buses\" from the nearby Russian city of Belgorod arrived in the centre. They delivered hardcore Kremlin activists, he said, some dressed in military-style fatigues. They waved Russian flags and cried: \"Russia, Russia\".\n", "d34_sg131": "The new government in Kiev alleges these visitors are paid provocateurs. It calls them \"tourists\". Together with local thugs, the \"tourists\" stormed the main administrative building, at the opposite end of the square, and evicted the Ukrainian nationalists who had been occupying it, brutally beating several of them. A student blogger from Moscow replaced the Ukrainian flag on the roof with a Russian one. (He posted video and photos of his exploits on social network site LiveJournal.)
