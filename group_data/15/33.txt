More than 270 people are still unaccounted for as efforts continue to rescue passengers aboard a South Korean ferry that sank off the countryâ€™s south-west coast on Wednesday morning.
The charges against Lee appear to shed some light on what authorities have focused on in their efforts to find out what happened to the ferry making its way Wednesday from Incheon to the resort island of Jeju. It sank in frigid waters 20 kilometers (roughly 12 miles) off the coast of South Korea's southern peninsula.
