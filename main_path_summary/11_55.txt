By coincidence, at about the same time that the LIGO discovery was announced, the House passed a bill requiring that National Science Foundation grants be justified “in the national interest.” It is doubtful that LIGO would have survived such political meddling. The bottom line is that whatever else it may be or lead to, the story of the chirp heard round the universe is simply cool. For proof, just listen to that little song.The director of the National Science Foundation has already implemented “national interest” guidelines for new grants. Contrary to your suggestion, the LIGO project would certainly fall under the legislation’s national interest definition to “promote the progress of science in the United States.”
