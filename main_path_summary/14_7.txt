In today's show, we explain how tensions have escalated in Ukraine, how sudden rain for a drought-stricken state made some matters worse, and how NASA plans to keep closer tabs on global weather. We also kick off Women's History Month with a report about a young woman who's making sports history at her high school.
3.  Can you think of any other natural geologic features, like the ice caves shown in the video, that attract tourists?  Explain.  Have you ever visited any of these kinds of formations?  If so, where did you go and what did you see?  What did you learn from the experience?  
On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.  
Please note that there may be a delay between the time when the video is available and when the transcript is published.
Key Concepts: Identify or explain these subjects you heard about in today's show:
1. What unique challenges might face a nation like Ukraine, whose people are deeply divided about their country's future? Can you think of potential diplomatic solutions to the situation there? In your view, should the international community get involved? If so, to what extent? If not, why not?
2. In what different ways might residents respond to a mandatory evacuation of their homes? Why do you think some choose to stay? What risks might they face if they do so?
3. How would you define "trailblazer"? What challenges might be experienced by a female competitor in a male-dominated sport? Why might male wrestlers respond in different ways to the challenge of competing against Julia Ernst? What lessons do you think she has learned from her wins (and losses)?
