Prices of computers and chocolate are likely to rise in early signs of inflation spurred by the falling value of the pound since Britain voted to leave the EU.
Both Scotland and Northern Ireland, constituent countries within the United Kingdom, voted in the referendum to remain in the EU, and the vote to leave has revived talk in both countries of leaving the UK instead.
The remain campaign predicted higher prices if Britain voted to leave the EU due to the higher cost of imports from the pound’s likely fall. Economists are predicting further falls in sterling’s value as the economy slows and some have raised the prospect of the pound slumping to parity with the US dollar.IMF cuts UK growth forecasts following Brexit vote Read more
It is a month since Britain voted to leave the European Union. What difference has it made to our economy and society so far?
When will the UK actually leave the EU?
The IMF predicts the UK economy will grow 1.7% in 2017, 0.9 percentage points lower than it estimated in April. But if the referendum campaign has taught us anything, it is that predictions about what would happen after a leave vote were tricky to get right.November will be the first time we see unemployment figures fully calculated post-referendum, comparing July, August and September 2016 with the months prior to the vote.
The first estimate of Q3 GDP figures that will cover July-September, will not be available until late October. That’s when we will start to know if the leave vote has tipped the economy into recession. The Bank of England didn’t think that had happened, which contrasts with Friday’s Markit survey, but there were already signs the economy was slowing down before the referendum.
