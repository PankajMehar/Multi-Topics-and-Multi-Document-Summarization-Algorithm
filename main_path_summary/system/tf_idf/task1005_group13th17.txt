Last month, the Chinese legislature proposed election rule changes for Hong Kong. Starting in 2017, they would allow residents to vote directly for the leader of the cityâ€™s government, the chief executive, but a nominating committee dominated by pro-Beijing loyalists would be used to restrict how many and which candidates could enter the contest.
The protesters were responding to China's decision to allow only Beijing-vetted candidates to stand in the city's elections for chief executive, Hong Kong's top civil position. 
Critics say that this means only candidates favored by Beijing will appear on the ballot, but Hong Kong's current chief executive, C.Y. Leung, writing in an op ed for CNN, says that this is not the case.
But many ordinary Hong Kongers insist they want full universal suffrage, rejecting Beijing's decision to allow only Beijing-vetted candidates to run for the 2017 election for chief executive.
On the question of electing the chief executive, the Basic Law, Hong Kong's "mini-constitution," provides that "the ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures."  
It is my fundamental and constitutional duty to work towards the goal of electing the chief executive by universal suffrage within that legal framework.
We want peace and democracy -- universal suffrage in 2017 -- but we abhor and reject "Occupy Central" for trying to hold Hong Kong hostage in the fight for its brand of democracy.
