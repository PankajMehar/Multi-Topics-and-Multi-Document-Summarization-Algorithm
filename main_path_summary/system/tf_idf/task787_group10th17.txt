On the one hand, this was expected. We know that mass bends space and time, and so when mass moves it really should cause ripples in space and time, in much the same way that a gymnast moving on the surface of a trampoline causes ripples in the cloth.
So, space is like the ocean and all the planets, stars and galaxies are like boats and objects sitting on its surface. Even though we can’t feel it, there are waves in space that make the Earth bob every so slightly. Those waves are caused by gravity.
If you put two heavy bowling balls on a trampoline, the trampoline will bend downwards under each ball and the balls will start rolling around and move towards each other as they fall into each other’s dent. The heavy balls stretch the trampoline (that’s why they create dents), and, in space, black holes stretch the universe in the same way.
A disturbance in the cosmos could cause space-time to stretch, collapse and even jiggle, like a mattress shaking when that sleeper rolls over, producing ripples of gravity: gravitational waves.
