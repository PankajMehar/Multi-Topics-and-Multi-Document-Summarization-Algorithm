Bilateral relationships and trade between them would continue after Britain's departure from the European Union, she said.
EU leaders have uniformly said they will not enter into formal exit negotiations with Britain until it triggers Article 50, and have urged Britain to move swiftly.
"These visits will be an opportunity to forge a strong working relationship that we can build upon and which I hope to develop with more leaders across the European Union in the weeks and months ahead," May said in a statement Wednesday.
But Merkel said that while the general issue of the impending Brexit would be broached, neither formal nor informal negotiations on the subject could begin until Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty -- which officially kicks off the exit process and opens a two-year window for exit negotiations -- was triggered.
Tensions over when EU exit begins
She said the business of negotiating Britain's exit from the bloc would take time and "require serious and detailed work."
She said that she understood that the delayed triggering of the article "will not please everyone."
