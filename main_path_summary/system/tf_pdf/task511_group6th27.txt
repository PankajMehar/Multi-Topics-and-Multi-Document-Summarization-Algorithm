The vote by Iraqi Kurds on their desire for independence, due to take place on Monday, poses real risks in an unstable region. But their case deserves to be heard
ERBIL, Iraq — After a century of yearning, the Kurds of Iraq have managed, at last, to pull off a vote for independence, but not without antagonizing nearly everyone in perhaps the world’s most volatile region.
But if anything, the vote, while satisfying the Kurds emotionally, may have set back their national aspirations.The response has been overwhelmingly negative. The rest of Iraq, the US, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the UK, the EU and the Arab League all oppose the vote thanks to concerns ranging from Kurdish secessionism within their own borders and the furthering of ethnic divisions to the immense dangers it poses in a perilously unstable region – particularly given that voting covers the disputed territories the Kurds have gained in the fight against Isis. The US and others want the vote postponed, understandably. But “later” is almost as unsatisfactory an answer as “never” to Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani and his supporters – and that too is understandable.
The referendum is “not the end itself”, Mr Barzani told the Guardian: the near-certain victory will declare the desire for independence. There is room for negotiation. But Erbil will not go back to the table with a Baghdad that has no incentive to compromise, armed only with vague expressions of international goodwill. The Kurds want a UN-mandated solution, with a clear agenda, putting them on a path to their end goal through measures such as an enforceable deal on sharing oil revenues – as agreed but not maintained after the Iraq war. And their arguments have merit.
