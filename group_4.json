That ensures that one of the biggest political offices \u2014 and Ms. May\u2019s old job \u2014 remains in the hands of a woman.

On Monday, Ms. May outlined some of the economic changes she hopes to make, speaking about taming excessive executive pay, and arguing that big multinational companies must pay their fair share in taxes.\n", "d42_sg15": "Just an hour or so before Ms. May spoke outside 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, Mr. Cameron stood in the same spot, flanked by his wife, Samantha, and their three children, paying tribute to his family and his key staff members who had supported him.\n", "d42_sg16": "\u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve our country as prime minister over these last six years, and to serve as the leader of my party for almost 11 years,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. \u201cMy only wish is continued success for this great country that I love so very much.\u201d\n", "d42_sg17": "Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.
