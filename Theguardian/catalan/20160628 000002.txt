(CNN) Police in Manchester, England, arrested two young men and a teenager in connection with an apparent hate incident on a tram Tuesday.
Video of the incident, which shows several men taunting a male commuter who appears to be of mixed race, quickly drew outrage after being posted online.
The incident occurred about 7.40 a.m. local time. The video shows the victim in a heated exchange with the suspects, who call him an "immigrant" and tell him to "get back to Africa." Several of the suspects appear to be holding bottles of beer, and at one point a suspect tries to flick some of it on the victim.
The subject of the abuse asks one of the suspects if he is a teenager before saying he had lived in the United Kingdom longer than the assailant. Other commuters on the train appear to come to the victim's defense.
