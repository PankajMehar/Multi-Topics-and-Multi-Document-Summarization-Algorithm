• The status of the roughly three million citizens of European Union countries who are not British citizens but live in Britain has become a huge topic of political concern. The government has refused to guarantee that they will be able to remain in Britain once the country leaves the European Union. “There has to be some symmetry between the treatment of U.K. nationals in E.U. countries and E.U. nationals in U.K. countries,” Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told the BBC, while adding that it was “most unlikely” that the Europeans would have to leave.

Your ‘Brexit’ Reading List
• Rafael Behr, a political columnist at The Guardian, offers a behind-the-scenes account of the Remain campaign’s failure to turn out voters and inspire pro-Europe Britons with a positive message.
• An upside of the crisis for British journalists: This is the story of a lifetime. “For journalists, has there ever been a better time to be alive?” Roy Greenslade, a journalism professor, asks in The Guardian.

• For the half-million Americans living in Britain, the fall in the pound could prompt a wave of demands that employers raise salaries, according to The Financial Times. Many large employers have “salary protection” plans to buffer employees from currency fluctuations, and they typically kick in when a currency falls 7 percent to 15 percent. So far, the pound is about 10 percent lower against the dollar from where it was before the referendum.
