SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean ferry that sank nearly three years ago, killing more than 300 people — most of them teenagers on a school trip — was raised to the surface on Thursday. It was an emotional moment for families who are still looking for their missing children and a step toward closing one of the most traumatic episodes in South Korea’s history.
The ferry, the 6,825-ton Sewol, capsized and sank off the southwestern tip of South Korea on April 16, 2014. The accident was the country’s worst catastrophe in decades, and it contributed to the recent ouster of President Park Geun-hye. The ship went under while teenagers trapped inside sent text messages asking for help that never came or saying goodbye to their families.
A monthslong underwater search of the ship ended after 295 bodies were recovered. Nine people who were on board remain missing, including four students and two teachers from Danwon High School in Ansan, south of Seoul, the South Korean capital. Of the 324 students from the school on board for a field trip, 250 drowned.
