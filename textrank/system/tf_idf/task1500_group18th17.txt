Some 300 people gather in Istanbul's Taksim Square, some waving Turkish flags. Army tanks and a military vehicle sit at the square.
After Mr. Erdoganâ€™s speech on Saturday, thousands of his supporters marched down Istiklal Street in Istanbul to Taksim Square, mostly waving Turkish flags and shouting in support of their president.
It felt like a rollicking street carnival. Women in head scarves filled the square, a truck played a song about Mr. Erdogan, and passing motorists honked and waved flags.
