This year, there has been a rash of strikes in the Chinese export industry – headlined by the strike of 30,000 shoe workers at Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings, in Dongguan, southern China. Two factors make conditions ripe. There is a labour shortage, with better jobs available in the service sector. At the same time, a slowing economy is forcing managers to try to claw back certain perks and benefits; at Yue Yuen, it was the underpayment of contributions to a retirement fund that sparked the trouble.
Most students from the Chinese mainland avoided the strike, though some watched from the sidelines.
Riot police remained on guard on the sidelines of the main protest area near the government headquarters, although not in large numbers.
The foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said the UK government did not condone the use of CS gas – a type of teargas – against the protesters. But he said the canisters being used by the Chinese riot police were a legitimate export. He told the BBC Daily Politics show: “CS gas is available from large numbers of sources around the world. To be frank, I think that is a rather immaterial point. They could buy CS gas from the US.”
