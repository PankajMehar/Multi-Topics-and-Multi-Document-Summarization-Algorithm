On the one hand, this was expected. We know that mass bends space and time, and so when mass moves it really should cause ripples in space and time, in much the same way that a gymnast moving on the surface of a trampoline causes ripples in the cloth.
So, space is like the ocean and all the planets, stars and galaxies are like boats and objects sitting on its surface. Even though we canâ€™t feel it, there are waves in space that make the Earth bob every so slightly. Those waves are caused by gravity.
