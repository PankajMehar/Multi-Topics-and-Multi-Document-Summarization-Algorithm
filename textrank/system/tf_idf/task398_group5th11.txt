IMF cuts UK growth forecasts following Brexit vote Read more
Following the June 23 vote to leave the EU, Britain now faces a complicated process of negotiations to remove itself from the bloc.
But Merkel said that while the general issue of the impending Brexit would be broached, neither formal nor informal negotiations on the subject could begin until Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty -- which officially kicks off the exit process and opens a two-year window for exit negotiations -- was triggered.
She said the business of negotiating Britain's exit from the bloc would take time and "require serious and detailed work."
It is a month since Britain voted to leave the European Union. What difference has it made to our economy and society so far?
When will the UK actually leave the EU?
The first estimate of Q3 GDP figures that will cover July-September, will not be available until late October. That’s when we will start to know if the leave vote has tipped the economy into recession. The Bank of England didn’t think that had happened, which contrasts with Friday’s Markit survey, but there were already signs the economy was slowing down before the referendum.
