London (CNN) Theresa May is meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin Wednesday on her first international trip as Britain's Prime Minister, for talks that she hopes will help smooth Brexit negotiations.
The trips to Paris and Berlin were intended to build May's relationships with key European leaders ahead of the critical Brexit negotiations.
Bilateral relationships and trade between them would continue after Britain's departure from the European Union, she said.
"These visits will be an opportunity to forge a strong working relationship that we can build upon and which I hope to develop with more leaders across the European Union in the weeks and months ahead," May said in a statement Wednesday.
She also stressed that Britain should not be limited by focusing exclusively on its relationship with its European neighbors but should instead look to build ties throughout the world.
It is a month since Britain voted to leave the European Union. What difference has it made to our economy and society so far?
