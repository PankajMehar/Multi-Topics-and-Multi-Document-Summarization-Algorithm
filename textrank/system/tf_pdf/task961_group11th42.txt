And so they did, on Sept. 14, in the form of a simple chirp created by the waves that, as the Times science reporter Dennis Overbye put it, “seems destined to take its place among the great sound bites of science, ranking with Alexander Graham Bell’s “Mr. Watson — come here” and Sputnik’s first beeps from orbit.”
