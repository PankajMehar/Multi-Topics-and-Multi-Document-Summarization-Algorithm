Turkey is enmeshed in several conflicts, both at home and abroad, and the upheaval wrought by the coup attempt will hinder Erdoğan’s response to all of them. Erdoğan has reignited a civil war with Kurdish rebels in south-east Turkey, and the arrests of so many senior officers, including the most senior general in that region, will logically hamper the Turkish state’s ability to stamp out Kurdish dissent.
“The coup attempt did a lot of damage to the democratic opposition in Turkey,” said one human rights lawyer. “This could have been a chance for Turkey to overcome polarisation and violence, to finally democratise the country. But instead it is used as a pretext for Erdoğan to galvanise power.”
Human rights groups have warned that Turkey, even in a state of emergency, needs to remain within the framework of international law.
