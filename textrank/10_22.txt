We did it,” said David Reitze, executive director of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo), at a press conference in Washington.
“That is, it will be an observatory, getting tens of events per year.”“This is transformational,” said Prof Alberto Vecchio, of the University of Birmingham, and one of the researchers at Ligo.
Now we have gravitational waves we are going to have a whole new picture of the universe, of the stuff that doesn’t emit light – dark matter, black holes,” he said.
We did it," said David Reitze, executive director of LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory , which was created to do just what Reitze announced.
The gravitational waves stretched and compressed space around Earth "like Jell-O," said Reitze.
"I think we're opening a window on the universe -- a window of gravitational wave astronomy."
