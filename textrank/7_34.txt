This time, Catalonia’s government has promised that the referendum will be binding, even if it is declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court and even if Catalan opponents of independence boycott it.
In two weeks, Catalans will go to the polls to vote in a referendum on whether to secede from Spain and form an independent republic.
Under the Catalan referendum law they are obliged to take part, but the law has been ruled illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.
