Gravitational waves: breakthrough discovery after a century of expectation Read more
In 1916, he told Karl Schwarzschild, the discoverer of black holes, that gravitational waves did not exist, then said they did.
Now we have gravitational waves we are going to have a whole new picture of the universe, of the stuff that doesn’t emit light – dark matter, black holes,” he said.
This has been corrected.The gravitational waves -- ripples in space-time -- were created by the merging of two black holes, Reitze said.
Black holes are a holy grail of the gravitational wave concept.
