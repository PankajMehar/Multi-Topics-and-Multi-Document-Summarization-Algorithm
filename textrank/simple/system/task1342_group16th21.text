Jerry Smith, the operations chief of the UN-led team that supervised the removal of Syria’s sarin stockpiles following the gas attack on the rebel-held Ghouta area of Damascus four years ago, said: “This absolutely reeks of 2013 all over again.” In that attack, more than 1,300 people were killed.
The opposition-run Health Department in Idlib Province, where the attack took place, said 69 people had died, providing a list of their names.
A US intelligence official said the attack reportedly killed 58 people, including 11 children.
