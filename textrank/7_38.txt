Carles Puigdemont, the leader of Catalonia, assured the regionâ€™s voters that the independence referendum would take place, despite efforts by the Madrid government and Spanish courts to block it.
In response, Carles Puigdemont, the leader of Catalonia, told Catalan television that no politician or court in Madrid could stop the referendum.
Madrid says the referendum is unconstitutional and so are the laws the Catalan parliament passed a week ago, which will in effect disconnect Catalonia from Spanish legislative and administrative control if the Yes vote prevails.
