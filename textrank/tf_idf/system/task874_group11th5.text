The National Science Foundation’s support for the LIGO project that led this effort (for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) is a perfect example of pursuing breakthrough science that is in the national interest.
In a Feb. 16 editorial, you criticized my bill, the Scientific Research in the National Interest Act, which recently passed the House requiring the National Science Foundation to explain how each project is worthy of taxpayer funding.
By coincidence, at about the same time that the LIGO discovery was announced, the House passed a bill requiring that National Science Foundation grants be justified “in the national interest.” It is doubtful that LIGO would have survived such political meddling.
