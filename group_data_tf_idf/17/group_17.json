When the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland, acting for the EU, negotiated a compromise agreement on February 22 that envisaged early elections, the crisis appeared to have been defused. Russia did not like the deal, but seemed ready to go along.\n", "d21_sg174": "But within 24 hours, the opposition had torn up the agreement. It forced Yanukovych from power and sacked the government.

In his latest phone call to Putin, on Thursday this week, Obama put forward a plan to resolve the stand-off diplomatically.

Putin is in no hurry to back off or back down. \n", "d21_sg180": "He has his tail up after a fortnight in which he exposed the hypocrisy and hollowness of much of western policy and politicians. His behavior, especially in Crimea, has been dangerous, wrong-headed and irresponsible in the extreme. In many ways, Putin is an unredeemed Cold War throwback. He is definitely not the sort of chap one would invite round for dinner, as a former British diplomat commented. The crisis could still explode in his and everyone else's face. But it was not unprovoked.\n", "d21_sg181": "And the Russian leader has an eye for precedent. Similar battles over so-called \"frozen conflicts\" and the rights of isolated ethnic groups loom elsewhere on Russia's periphery, in Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and maybe Belarus and the Baltic states too. Putin is putting down a marker, even as he plays Obama and Kerry for fools.\n", "d21_sg182": "Whatever they think in Washington, and whatever the financial markets say, it's working for him personally. Latest opinion polls in Russia show Putin's popularity soaring. One of these days western leaders will drop the pious cant, learn to stop under-estimating him, and recognize Russia's leader-for-life as the canny, very dangerous, utterly unscrupulous opponent he is.\n", "d21_sg183": "Crimea's parliament has voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia, and has scheduled a referendum for its residents to decide whether to stay or go.

Crimea has a population of about 2 million. \n", "d21_sg185": "Crimea is known as a pro-Russian area, but it is not without its diversity. \n", "d21_sg186": "The autonomous region has a 60% ethnic Russian population, having been part of Russia until it was ceded to Ukraine in 1954 by the Soviet Union.\n", "d21_sg187": "But not everyone may be as keen on coming under Moscow's direct influence. A quarter of the peninsula's population is Ukrainian and about 12% Crimean Tatars, a predominantly Muslim group.\n", "d21_sg188": "While the Crimean parliament voted to hold the referendum, at the federal level, Ukrainian leaders say a referendum is illegal. \n", "d21_sg189": "It's an \"illegitimate decision,\" interim Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Thursday. \"Crimea was, is, and will be an integral part of Ukraine.\"\n", "d21_sg190": "Justice Minister Pavlo Petrenko said the Crimean parliament's decision is illegal because under the constitution, only national referendums are permitted.\n", "d21_sg191": "The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has sent a military observer mission to Ukraine, but it can only expand its mission to monitor the vote if the Ukrainian government invites it to. \n", "d21_sg192": "See above.

South Ossetia and Abkhazia are two separatist regions of Georgia that Russia occupied in 2008.\n", "d21_sg199": "For Russia, peeling off a slice of territory from Ukraine isn't productive, Cecire wrote. Its goal is to get all of Ukraine under its influence.\n", "d21_sg200": "Taking steps toward separatism has only deepened the crisis, as Russian intervention has galvanized anti-Russian sentiment in other parts of Ukraine. \n", "d21_sg201": "The referendum, scheduled for March 16, will probably just add fuel to the fire. \n", "d21_sg202": "United States President Barack Obama has now paved the way for imposing economic sanctions against Russia. However, these would be an ineffective and naive response by the U.S. to the crisis in Ukraine.\n", "d21_sg203": "Economic sanctions have little independent usefulness for the pursuit of non-economic goals. \n", "d21_sg204": "This is not to say that sanctions never work, but rather that 95% of cases are unsuccessful. In many cases, sanctions will make the political situation worse.\n", "d21_sg205": " Nationalism often makes states and societies willing to endure considerable punishment rather than abandon their national interests. \n", "d21_sg206": "Modern states, simply put, are not that fragile -- sanctions can hurt a regime, but they cannot break it. In this way, imposing economic sanctions on a state is similar to backing an angry dog into a corner -- in most cases, the dog will become more vicious, and more defensive.\n", "d21_sg207": "History might seem to indicate otherwise. Economic sanctions often go hand-in-hand with military intervention, which can sprout misleading conclusions. \n", "d21_sg208": "This is true of the sanctions we imposed on Iraq in 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait: U.S. military intervention in 1991 was still necessary to force his retreat. Few would say that economic sanctions were successful in kicking him out. Indeed, sanctions continued after the Gulf War with little to no effect, until we finally removed the regime by force in 2003. \n", "d21_sg209": "Further, sanctions typically take the form of a great power or coalition seeking to leverage a relatively weak state. \n", "d21_sg210": "The suggestion that they might be effective against a major global power like Russia is seriously flawed. Even those who do believe sanctions might work on Iran would likely find the idea of imposing sanctions on Russia to be preposterous.\n", "d21_sg211": "There are two reasons why. First, even if economic sanctions were an effective form of leverage, Russia can squeeze us almost effectively as we can squeeze them. Sergei Glazyev, a Kremlin economist, simply threatened to not repay debt to U.S. bankers in response to American-imposed sanctions. Between great powers, leverage is a two-way street.\n", "d21_sg212": "Second, Putin is clearly prepared to incur economic costs to accomplish his objectives in Ukraine. Even without sanctions, the deployment of troops to Crimea has already affected the Russian economy. On March 3 the Moscow stock market fell more than 10% which, as a Reuters article pointed out, wiped nearly $60 billion off the value of Russian companies -- more than the $51 billion spent on the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Meanwhile, Putin's approval ratings remained high. \n", "d21_sg213": "By threatening sanctions, Obama is not giving Russia President Vladimir Putin enough credit. Of course the Russian leader has considered this scenario, and it did not deter him from occupying Crimea. \n", "d21_sg214": "Furthermore, if we impose sanctions and Russia breaks commitments with U.S. bankers in response, what would be the effect? From a strategic standpoint, none. We certainly wouldn't let Russia use economic threats to dictate our foreign policy, no matter what the economic cost; why should we expect the Russian leadership to budge?\n", "d21_sg215": "The key to keeping Ukraine unified is to take away support for Russian annexation. This means solidifying support for the new government in Kiev among the Russian population in the East, especially in Crimea.\n", "d21_sg216": "Obama must encourage the new government in Ukraine to strengthen economic and political ties with the pro-Russian population. This means bringing in election monitors to encourage faith and participation in the new regime, and creating new economic programs to bolster well-being in the eastern part of the country. The U.S. should offer support to fund those efforts. \n", "d21_sg217": "The West must remember that in 2011, 70% of Crimeans considered Ukraine their \"motherland,\" despite most of them being Russian-speaking. In other words, until the proposed EU deal went sour, there was little sentiment in Crimea for secession or annexation. A return to these conditions in Ukraine, and not economic sanctions against Russia, is the key to stopping Putin.\n", "d21_sg218": "Read: Mapping the divisions in Ukraine Zakaria: Sanctions against Russia are just symbolic\n", "d21_sg219": "That's where the crisis in Ukraine stood Thursday after lawmakers in Crimea voted in favor of leaving the country for Russia and putting it to a regional vote in 10 days. \n", "d21_sg220": "This act drew widespread condemnation, with Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk calling such a referendum \"an illegitimate decision.\"\n", "d21_sg221": "It was a sentiment echoed by several world leaders, who called the scheduled vote and possible pullout violations of Ukrainian and international law.\n", "d21_sg222": "\"Any discussion about the future of Ukraine must include the legitimate government of Ukraine,\" said U.S. President Barack Obama. \"In 2014, we are well beyond the days when borders can be redrawn over the heads of democratic leaders.\"\n", "d21_sg223": "It's not clear how easily the region could split off from Ukraine even if the referendum endorses the move. \n", "d21_sg224": "The developments came at a dizzying pace Thursday as Yatsenyuk joined emergency talks in Brussels, Belgium, called by leaders of the European Union who support the Kiev government and want to de-escalate the crisis.\n", "d21_sg225": "The EU and the United States announced plans to freeze the assets of Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted as Ukraine's president after he turned his back on a trade deal with the EU in favor of one with Russia.\n", "d21_sg226": "The rejected trade deal prompted months of protests that culminated in February with bloody street clashes that left dozens dead and Yanukovych out of office. \n", "d21_sg227": "Interpol said it is reviewing a request by Ukrainian authorities that would allow for the arrest of Yanukovych on charges of abuse of power and murder, an allegation tied to the death of protesters. \n", "d21_sg228": "Moscow has denounced the events that led to Yanukovych's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities, putting the two countries on a collision course over control of the Crimea, a peninsula on the Black Sea that has long ties to Russia and has thousands of Russian troops stationed there. \n", "d21_sg229": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted he has the right to use military force in Ukraine if necessary to protect ethnic Russians under threat in Crimea.
