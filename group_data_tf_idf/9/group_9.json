There has been a revolution in Kiev, the abrupt exit of the country's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, and military occupation. Russia has seized Crimea, denounced the country's new interim government as \"fascist\" and launched an all-out information war to justify Crimea's annexation.\n", "d40_sg3": "The uprising against Yanukovych started last November when he dropped plans to sign an association agreement with the EU, and instead announced a $15bn bailout from Moscow. Last week, Ukraine's new interim prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, signed the original agreement in Brussels. In theory, at least, this puts Ukraine on a path towards European integration.\n", "d40_sg4": "But in the heavily industrialised Donbass area of eastern Ukraine, many are wondering what this geopolitical tug of war might mean for them. The Donets basin \u2013 the political home of Yanukovych and his Party of Regions \u2013 hosts numerous Soviet-era factories: machine-building works, steel and chemical plants, mines, and medium-sized businesses that make fridges.\n", "d40_sg5": "At the pithead, Yefromov was gloomy about the mine's prospects. Instead of the EU, Ukraine would be better off joining Vladimir Putin's rival Eurasian Union, he suggested. \"It's our only chance,\" he said.\n", "d40_sg6": "Lydia Popova, a mine employee for more than four decades, and the editor of its internal newspaper, disagreed. \"Joining Russia's customs union is like going back to the USSR. Ukraine wants to be independent from Putin,\" she said in Russian. \"I'm a Ukrainian. The people who work hardest underground here are the Ukrainians.\"\n", "d40_sg7": "Popova conceded that many mines in the area had closed, including five in the nearby town named after Alexey Stakhanov, the Soviet coal-miner made famous by the communist party for his quota-busting records. \"We are still profitable,\" she said.\n", "d40_sg8": "Popova may be right. There is still a demand for coal in Ukraine, even though much of the industry has crumbled. Big factories use coal, as do villagers not connected to the electricity grid.

The new provincial governor, local oligarch Serhiy Taruta, pledged this week to shut the kopanki down.\n", "d40_sg9": "Donetsk was founded in the 1860s by an enterprising Welshman, John Hughes, who constructed its first steel mill.

The EU says the deal will help trade between Moscow and Kiev.\n", "d40_sg13": "But the news is less good for the east's traditional heavy industries, and a potential disaster for its machine-building and metallurgy businesses. Many of their exports traditionally go to Russia and other post-Soviet countries such as Kazakhstan. Steel-making factories, moreover, are heavily dependent on Russian gas supplies. Moscow has signalled that it plans to raise the price Kiev pays from $268.50 per 1,000 cubic metres \u2013 the figure Yanukovych agreed with Putin late last year \u2013 to about $400.\n", "d40_sg14": "The director of Donetsk's steel plant said he worried what would happen if Russia shut its border to Ukrainian goods. \"This would be deeply unwelcome,\" Alexander Seliverstov, told Ukraine's news agency UNIAN. \"Traditionally 20-25% of our production goes to Russia.

They pre-dated this latest crisis, he said, and were possibly insoluble. Some factories had moved with the times. They had improved their ecological standards.

Some politicians have been openly speculating as to whether the sanctions shortlist could be further extended to take in some of London's best-known Russians, in particular the Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich.\n", "d41_sg5": "\"At some stage, if the oligarchs aren't careful, they could end up with their assets here being frozen,\" said one City of London financier, who deals with wealthy Russian clients. \"It is already stopping new money coming in and stopping the money here from being used. Some Russians are trying to get money out [of Europe] and into Singapore, which is the new Cyprus [formerly the banking centre favoured by wealthy Russians].

There are some who are here because they are not close to Putin.\"\n", "d41_sg6": "However, despite the visibility of some Russians in the capital, Cameron's 2011 sales patter did not turn Russia into a major destination for British exporters: German machine tools and French military aircraft are worth far more to Russia than British goods. In 2012 the UK sold $8bn of goods to Russia, but that compares with $14bn sold by France and is dwarfed by the $38bn from Germany.\n", "d41_sg7": "Perhaps surprisingly, Russia is not even a big customer for the City of London's banks and law firms. The UK sold \u00a31.2bn of banking advice and insurance to Russia in 2012: a big number, but only 1% of UK financial service exports, according to analysis by the Open Europe thinktank.\n", "d41_sg8": "This figure includes the handsome fees paid to lawyers and bankers that help Russian companies float on the London stock exchange: 53 Russian companies have a listing on the main stockmarket here, including the state energy giant Gazprom and Russia's largest bank Sberbank. A further 15 Russian companies are listed on the smaller Alternative Investment Market. But Russian company listings peaked before the financial crisis. Data from Dealogic shows that 11 Russian companies gained a prestigious London listing in 2007; last year that had dwindled to just one \u2013 the bank and credit card company TCS, which raised $1bn when it floated in October. If the financial spigots of the City of London were turned off, it would be Russia that has the most to lose: since 2002 Russian companies have raised $406bn on London's capital markets. While these loans and bonds generate healthy interest rates for the international banks headquartered in London, few think the City would struggle without them.\n", "d41_sg9": "Raoul Ruparel, head of economic research at Open Europe, said: \"While here are certain firms and sectors linked closely to Russia, I think in the broad sense the pinch wouldn't be huge and the City would be able to adjust and find business elsewhere.\" The furore over a line in an official document about the UK's intention to keep the City open to Russia overstates Russia's importance, he said.\n", "d41_sg10": "The UK has provided one of the \"most hawkish\" voices on sanctions in Europe. \"Whether some lawyers and business advisers are not generating fees is not going to be high up on Europe's agenda on the sanctions. It will be more 'where is Finland going to get 100% of its energy from?'\"\n", "d41_sg11": "The impact on London's overheated property market is also likely to be muted. Russians account for 2% of the prime London luxury market, according to the upmarket estate agents Savills. While political turmoil could make London's townhouses an even more attractive safe haven for wealthy Russians and Ukrainians, a spokesperson said: \"We've seen no real change and nor do we expect any.\"\n", "d41_sg12": "Another City financier, who has been involved in deals conducted by some of London's most high-profile Russian oligarchs, said: \"I don't think there was lots of Russian money deposited here. Russians will not necessarily use London banks when Switzerland is good for that. Russian family offices [that manage private Russian wealth from London] will be moving money out, but that would have been done immediately. Property, which a lot of Russians do have in London, is less liquid.\n", "d41_sg13": "\"I don't think they [rich Russians in London] are particularly freaking out, as they had already put money where it couldn't be got at. Anyway, their view is that the UK, Germany and France will not do anything on sanctions that will be particularly nasty. Is Abramovich worried he's going to be goose-stepped out of his London home? No.\"", "d41_sg14": "Nigel Farage intensified his attack on the EU's \"vanity\" foreign policy on Thursday as he accused Brussels of poking the \"Russian bear with a stick\" over Ukraine and of deepening the Syrian civil war by giving false hope to forces hoping to topple the Assad regime.\n", "d41_sg15": "Amid widespread criticism of the Ukip leader's claim in his TV debate with Nick Clegg that the EU had \"blood on its hands\" after the violence in Kiev, Farage said the EU had destabilised a series of countries.\n", "d41_sg16": "The Ukip leader went on the offensive after political leaders expressed astonishment at his claim in the debate with the deputy prime minister that the EU was to blame for the bloodshed after giving false hope to people in western Ukraine when it offered a partnership agreement to the ousted president, Viktor Yanukovych.\n", "d41_sg17": "The deputy prime ministerClegg said he was \"extraordinarily surprised\" that the Ukip leader had allowed his \"loathing of the EU\" to prompt him to say in their televised LBC debate that the EU had blood on its hands in Ukraine.\n", "d41_sg18": "Lord Ashdown, the former Liberal Democrat leader, accused Farage of having given comfort to Putin.
