But if the European Union is alarmed about Britain leaving, it is still more alarmed \u2013 from Belgium to France to Italy \u2013 about separatist movements destroying cohesion from within. And about a Spain, 40 years after democracy returned, lurching into unpredictable confrontation as other regions \u2013 the Basque country, Galicia \u2013 stage their own UDIs. There is still room for negotiation here. Madrid has already offered talks on autonomy issues. If the Catalan government can demonstrate a consistent demand and produce properly monitored plans for an eventual referendum, perhaps with a higher ceiling than 50.1%, then that is an approach that might heal the wounds \u2013 division, anger, increasing intimidation \u2013 already opening in society.

Close to 900 people are injured as police attempt to stop the referendum from taking place. The Catalan government says 90% voted for independence on a turnout of 43%. Spanish government takes control of Catalonia and dissolves its parliament after secessionist Catalan MPs voted to establish an independent republic. Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, fires regional president, Carles Puigdemont, and orders regional elections to be held on 21 December.\n", "d55_sg3": "Almost 2.3 million people voted in that referendum, resisting a campaign to put them off exercising their democratic right, designed by Spain\u2019s interior ministry and carried out by 10,000 national police and paramilitary police sent from all over Spain to Catalonia, which led to large numbers of peaceful voters being beaten with batons and hit by rubber bullets. In spite of thousands of voters being blocked from the polls by these brutal attacks, 43% of the eligible voters still managed to vote, and in the districts where the police did not act, the participation rate was over 50%. Overall, 90% of the votes cast on 1 October were in favour of independence.\n", "d55_sg4": "The agreement reached between Barcelona and Madrid blew up by midday on 26 October, when Puigdemont learned that the Spanish government was not going to fulfil its part of the bargain. PM Rajoy\u2019s Popular party, supported by the nationalist radicals in the Ciudadanos party, decided to suspend Catalonia\u2019s devolved powers regardless of whether Puigdemont called regional elections \u2013 as he had been asked to do \u2013 or not. When this became clear, Catalonia\u2019s parliamentary majority decided to bring the parliament into session in order to implement the mandate for independence.\n", "d55_sg5": "It is understandable that there's more than reasonable doubt about the fairness of the highly politicised Spanish courts\n", "d55_sg6": "Therefore, on the following day, Catalonia formally declared independence \u2013 all the while still calling for negotiations with Madrid to implement this declaration. But simultaneously, Spain\u2019s senate approved the immediate application of article 155 of the Spanish constitution in order to impose direct rule on Catalonia. This is a measure that has never been used since Spain\u2019s post-Franco transition to democracy, not even during the worst years of Eta terrorist violence in the Basque country.\n", "d55_sg7": "Spain\u2019s suspension of Catalonia\u2019s home rule was immediate and implacable, and went far beyond what is established in the Spanish constitution. At a cabinet meeting on the evening of 27 October, Rajoy\u2019s government approved the immediate removal of the Catalan government from office \u2013 which represented the absolute majority in Catalonia\u2019s regional parliament \u2013 substituting it with direct rule by Spain\u2019s Popular party government, despite the fact that this party holds just 8% of the seats in Catalonia\u2019s regional parliament.\n", "d55_sg8": "Among other measures approved with the goal of shutting down the Catalan government\u2019s ability to communicate with the international community \u2013 one of the obsessions of the Rajoy government \u2013 it was ordered to shut all its delegations abroad, except for the office in Brussels, where the head is being replaced. It was also ordered to close the Public Diplomacy Council of Catalonia (Diplocat), a public/private consortium made up of some 40 organisations whose purpose was to strengthen links between Catalan society and the rest of the world.\n", "d55_sg9": "In the face of Spain\u2019s article 155 offensive, and the insistent rumours of planned repression that could lead to much bloodshed if Catalonia\u2019s government attempted to implement its declaration of independence, Puigdemont and his government decided to postpone these objectives, making peace and social cohesion the priority over everything else. Today all the ministers of the legitimate government of Catalonia, as well as the officials of the speakers\u2019s office at the Catalan parliament, have been summoned to court in Madrid to answer charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of government funds.\n", "d55_sg10": "The bail has been set at \u20ac6 million, and they each face jail sentences of between 15 and 30 years. This is after the leaders of two of Catalonia\u2019s main pro-independence civil society groups were sent to preventative detention in a Madrid jail to await sentencing after being similarly charged with sedition. There is irrefutable proof that the two leaders were attempting to stop the spontaneous public demonstration that occurred to protest the arrest of 15 senior Catalan government officials from deteriorating into violence, yet they were charged with fomenting unrest.\n", "d55_sg11": "Spanish court threatens deposed Catalan leader Puigdemont with arrest Read more\n", "d55_sg12": "It is therefore understandable that there is a more than reasonable doubt about the fairness of the highly politicised Spanish courts. The charges launched today are eminently political, and have the objective \u2013 as openly stated by various PP party officials \u2013 to severely punish and make examples of the leaders of Catalonia\u2019s political and civil society self-determination movement.\n", "d55_sg13": "This is a strategy of revenge that is not only ineffective but also totally counterproductive \u2013 it merely strengthens this movement in the upcoming Catalan regional elections that the Spanish government itself called for 21 December. The pro-independence movement has agreed to participate in these elections because it will always defend the use of ballot boxes, and now it will be the ballot boxes that will defend our new Catalan republic.\n", "d55_sg14": "\u2022 Jordi Sol\u00e9 and Josep-Maria Terricabras are MEPs for Green/European Free Alliance, Ramon Tremosa is an MEP for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe", "d55_sg15": "(CNN) Spain's high court has ordered eight former ministers from Catalonia's dissolved government to be detained without bail, while the state prosecutor sought a Europe-wide arrest warrant for ousted leader Carles Puigdemont.\n", "d55_sg16": "Puigdemont left Spain and appeared in Brussels on Monday, the same day Spain's state prosecutor announced he was seeking charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds against him and 13 ex-ministers.\n", "d55_sg17": "The high court, known as the the Audiencia Nacional, summoned Puigdemont and the former ministers over their contentious independence drive, but only nine of them turned up at the session Thursday, and without Puigdemont.\n", "d55_sg18": "The judge ordered eight be remanded in custody, while the ninth was granted bail of 50,000 euros ($58,000).\n", "d55_sg19": "Jaume Alonso Cuevillas, the lawyer for most of the former ministers, said the decision was \"politically motivated\" and \"disproportionate,\" arguing that judge could have simply seized their passports to stop them from leaving the country.\n", "d55_sg20": "Puigdemont and the other four ministers are believed to still be in the Belgian capital. The state prosecutor in Madrid asked the court to issue national and European arrest warrants for all five.\n", "d55_sg21": "Puigdemont's no-show was the latest act of defiance from the renegade leader, who has caused consternation in Madrid following an independence referendum on October 1, which Spain's Constitutional Court ruled illegal. The crisis came to a head last week when the Catalan Parliament declared unilateral independence.\n", "d55_sg22": "In response, Madrid sacked Puigdemont and his government, and stripped Catalonia of its cherished autonomy.\n", "d55_sg23": "Puigdemont: Charges 'punish ideas'\n", "d55_sg24": "A separate case against six other Catalan lawmakers related to the independence bid was adjourned at the Supreme Court. All six, including Parliament speaker Carme Forcadell, showed up to the session.\n", "d55_sg25": "Puigdmeont, who still considers himself Catalonia's rightful leader, denied he was evading justice, claiming that the charges had no legal basis and sought \"only to punish ideas,\" according to his spokesperson.\n", "d55_sg26": "\"We are facing a political trial,\" the spokesperson said.\n", "d55_sg27": "According to the spokesperson, the former ministers who turned up to court Thursday did so to make a complaint against the Spanish judicial system's \"lack of guarantees\" to allow the pursuit of political ideas.\n", "d55_sg28": "In a video message recorded in Belgium and released Thursday, Puigdemont condemned the detention of members of his cabinet as an attack on democracy. He calling the move a \"very, very bad mistake.\"\n", "d55_sg29": "He said that \"political imprisonments without precedents are unacceptable in Europe and in the 21st century.\"\n", "d55_sg30": "\"We have to fight it the way Catalans do, like we fight the things that have made us big as a country, as a nation and as a society,\" Puigdemont said. \"Without violence, with peace and respect for all options.\"\n", "d55_sg31": "Puigdemont's Belgian lawyer, Paul Bekaert, told Reuters the former leader would cooperate with Spanish and Belgian authorities.\n", "d55_sg32": "\"The climate is not good, it is better to take some distance,\" he said.\n", "d55_sg33": "Puigdemont has denied he traveled to Brussels to seek political asylum. In public remarks on Tuesday, he claimed he was in the Belgian capital to \"to act with freedom and safety\" and to seek support from Europe in finding a diplomatic solution.", "d56_sg0": "The EU countries may be right that Catalonia is legally a matter of Spanish constitutional law. But they should also be frightened. Catalonia is Europe\u2019s problem.\n", "d56_sg1": "The imprisonment on remand of eight Catalan politicians, on blatantly political charges, and the Belgian asylum sought by its president, appears to be an engineered confrontation.\n", "d56_sg2": "Two days ago, the Madrid government reneged on an agreement that it would not suspend the Barcelona government if it did not declare independence and agreed to new local elections next month. Madrid then proceeded with suspension, and Catalonia duly proceeded with declaration \u2013 though with no mention of implementation. Madrid immediately arrested those Catalan politicians (and officials) it could find, on charges of rebellion and treason.\n", "d56_sg3": "So far, so absurd. No poll has yet delivered a clear majority of Catalans for independence. Barcelona has proceeded within accepted democratic norms and without recourse to violence \u2013 unlike Madrid in the government\u2019s efforts to stop the recent referendum.\n", "d56_sg4": "Never in the long and far bloodier fight of the Basques for independence was the Basque leadership ever imprisoned. Catalonia now faces an election next month with the prospect of its entire independence leadership in prison.\n", "d56_sg5": "Catalonia is being watched, with varying degrees of intensity, by Basques, Bretons, Flemings, Scots, Bavarians, Silesians, Ukrainians, Transylvanians, Venetians, Corsicans and others. Its struggle resonates among increasingly nationalist Poles, Bohemians, Hungarians and Greeks, across Europe\u2019s patchwork of regional sensitivities and long-harboured grievances. Old feuds are rekindled and jealousies revived. Hypocritical Britain cannot talk. It long opposed Irish separatism and denied devolution to Scotland and Wales, while it sent soldiers to aid the break-up of Yugoslavia.\n", "d56_sg6": "It is hopeless to seek recourse from these woes in statute books and legal niceties. Self-determination has been the essence of Europe\u2019s stability since Woodrow Wilson\u2019s 14-point programme for Europe\u2019s future in 1917. How such determination is defined may be moot: what of the self-determination of Spaniards against that of Catalans? But it is in Europe\u2019s interest to seek that definition, to formulate protocols whereby separatism can be resolved into grades of autonomy. European statehood has long been a \u201cvale of tiers\u201d.\n", "d56_sg7": "Since the EU itself is inherently centralist, it makes sense for the Council of Europe, the 47-nation organisation which deals with democracy and human rights across the European continent, to undertake such a task, urgently. The EU has worked itself into a political straitjacket, such that few of its member nations would dare hold a referendum on continued membership. This cannot be healthy for the EU or for Europe. The rising tide of identity politics is now the greatest threat to Europe\u2019s free development. Catalonia is not a little local difficulty. It is an awful warning.\n", "d56_sg8": "\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"}, "steamming": {"d0_sg0": ["almost", "immediately", "catalan", "spanish", "politician", "addition", "point",
