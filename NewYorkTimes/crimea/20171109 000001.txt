MADRID — A judge who sits on Spain’s Supreme Court on Thursday granted bail to a handful of Catalan lawmakers awaiting trial on rebellion charges in contrast with the jailing last week of former members of the Catalan government.
Judge Pablo Llarena set bail of €150,000, or about $175,000, for Carme Forcadell, who, as speaker of the Catalan Parliament, had read out Catalonia’s declaration of independence from Spain on Oct. 27, shortly before it was approved by separatist lawmakers.
Four other Catalan lawmakers were granted bail of €25,000, or about $29,000, while a sixth was freed on Thursday without bail.
In his ruling, Judge Llarena said that the lawmakers were allowed to post bail because they had either agreed to leave politics or pledged to resume their political activities “within the constitutional framework.” After the judge’s ruling, Ms. Forcadell was taken to a Madrid jail around midnight on Thursday, but her lawyer told reporters that she was likely to post bail on Friday.

Last month, Spain’s attorney general demanded that 20 Catalan politicians be prosecuted on charges ranging from rebellion and sedition to the misuse of public funds while organizing an independence referendum on Oct. 1 that had been declared illegal by the Spanish government and courts.
